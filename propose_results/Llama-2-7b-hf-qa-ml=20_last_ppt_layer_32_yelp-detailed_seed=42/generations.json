    "### Input:\nThis review is for the outside seating area since it was too nice a day to sit inside.  I have a hard time believing that Emeril himself came up with the menu here, as it's just regular bar food, and nothing special. \\n\\nThey roped us in with the zillions of ads they had in the Palazzo advertising $5 apps during happy hour and cheap buckets of beer.  Well we were in a hurry to get something quick before the Phantom, so we didn't do the buckets, but asked for a happy hour app menu.  There were like two things to choose from, and it sounded like they were tiny portions.  So, as I'm sure most people end up doing, we just ordered from the regular menu anyway.  We had the bbq pork nachos, which I didn't really enjoy at all.  The bbq sauce was much too sweet and didn't go with the rest of the ingredients.  I would have liked the nachos and pork separately, but I just didn't think they paired very well.\\n\\nI liked that they had a pool table or two outside, but like I said, I can't comment on the inside.  My guess is the real appeal of this place is watching a game with your buddies, not the food.  I just don't understand why they had to slap Emeril's name on it.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "ish selection was almost non-exsistant and the polish they did have were old or close to being empty. There are also no dryers at this place. The only upside to it taking 2 and a half hours was at least my nails were able to dry naturally. \\n\\nDuring my pedicure my nails were not shaped and cuticles were not cut and fixed. The girl used this tool that almost looked like an eraser to push back my cuticles, not remove them. She then slapped some polish on my toes and that was that.\\n\\nSimilarly, the manicure was nothing special either. No shaping of my nails at all and again the same eraser tool was used to push back, not remove my cuticles. I like my nails short and square. I grow them out before a mani to let the person cut, shape and polish. No cutting of my nails was done and the shaping was horrible. Some nails came out square, some came out rather round and others came out who knows what. \\n\\nLastly, I had my eyebrows done. I just needed them cleaned up, nothing drastic. The  girl clearly didn't full understand and who knows what she waxed off because my eyebrows looked mostly the same after. She then also insisted on putting a brow liner on my brows. I have fairly thick and dark brows, so I don't need any altering make up wise for my brows. Despite saying no thank you when she asked if I wanted some, she did it anyway. She also proceeded to give me a full face of make up, despite my having make up on and saying no thanks. The make up was uneven, and not at all my style. I ended up leaving looking like a crazy person.  \\n\\nThis place wasn't the worst but it certainly wasn't great and I don't know that I will be back. If you are just looking for someone to put polish on your toes or fingers you may love this place, but for someone that actually cares how their nails and toes look I don't know that I would recommend it.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "### Input:\nThis was my first \\\"Fish Camp\\\" experience and overall I thought it was pretty decent. I made the mistake of checking out the Yelp reviews after I ordered my small fried shrimp platter. Someone posted a photo of the shrimp that were not deveined  which  I could have gone without seeing. I tried to suck it up because the shrimp were miniature so I would imagine most of the time they are not deveined but the breading hides it. Anyway, I survived and the shrimp tasted just fine. The cocktail sauce was good and spicy, and side-note, they serve awesome ranch dressing. \\n\\nOverall the food was pretty good and super plentiful ..the small platter (around $8.50) easily made two meals.  \\n\\nWhere they fell off for me was cleanliness. The place just felt dirty....basically everything on the table seemed to have a thin layer of grease on it.  I know it's tough when serving fried food to keep menus and tables clean, but when large crumbs fall out of the menu that's a good sign they need a little scrubbin. \\n\\nThe service was on the slower side but they were busy splitting bills for a large birthday party.

Also, do not move anything in the minibar - if you do - there you go - you will be charged a fee of $50.  Don't you even touch anything - if you do - there will be charge of $50.  It's a scam!  In addition, they charged us for some items from the minibar just \\\"out of the blue\\\", things we never took from the minibar. The two pillowcases were not clean (stained) and they didn't replace them during our 4-day stay in this hotel. \\n\\nThere are some hidden fees, for example a resort fee of $28 per night, that includes Internet Access.

    "in Charlotte.  If you know of a good Italian bakery (or other), please email it to me.  If it's good, I will get you a gift card from there.  The only reason I think people give this bakery a good rating, is because they compare it to a super market \\\"bakery.\\\"  Down south, super market bakeries are not bakeries, they're just a point of sale for terrible process and sometimes pre-frozen food.  This bakery is on par with the ever awful Harris Teeter.  \\n\\nI don't know what, or if any, of the food here is actually made on site.  I gave this place 3 attempts.  The pastries are dry and flavorless.  I had lemon meringue pie, and it was still partly frozen.  FROZEN!  A bakery should make ALL baked goods on site.  Even the bread.  Nothing should be delivered there by truck except raw materials.  At the end of the day, all food is either thrown out or donated.  This is how it's done at a real bakery.  If you do keep yesterdays food, wrap it and discount it making it known that it's yesterdays good.  \\n\\nI have standards for bakeries and delis because I grew up in NY.  But even the bakery in Michigan where I went to university blew away any bakery in Charlotte, and that was in the midwest...aka \\\"the rustbelt.\\\"  \\n\\nSTOP REWARDING SUB-PAR FOOD CHARLOTTE.  Establish a standard, and don't waste your money on those who don't meet it.  I know it's difficult, because since moving here, I often find myself settling for somewhere because at least they have the item I want, even though it's not any good.  We must constantly remind ourselves that we're going out and paying for GOOD food, not just food.  Go up north and visit some bakeries and stop giving this place 4 and 5 stars.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

The selection of microbrewed bottles is pretty extensive, and certainly better than the selection you'll find anywhere else Downtown.  The loss of a star is for two things - no draft beer and no food.  I personally love draft beer, so I wouldn't mind seeing a few taps in here.  Some sort of bar menu would also be good, but that's less of an issue for me.

In the summer, the restaurant opens its garage-door wall to the warm air and puts out tables and chairs on the patio--sit here, but prepare to wait if you come on a Friday evening. The food is decent--my pollo asado (roasted chicken) with yuca fries were good but not great (for ~$18 there was a little too much chicken). The white sangria with ginger is refreshing, but very pricey ($23 for a pitcher). The Mexican food is not the best in PGH and the vegetarian entrees DO disappoint.

    "### Input:\nI had been to The Improv about 20 years ago when it was at The Riv, and when we left there I remember thinking about how bad it was. I also remember watching Bud Friedman's A Night At The Improv on TV so I knew this was not Improvisational  comedy. The folks complaining about that are probably just too young to remember The Improv. It's always been stand up comedy.\\n \\nOK, here goes. This is by far the worst stand-up comedy show I have ever been to. Even worse than i remember at The Improv 20 years ago. The host guy was moderately funny & actually improved as he got warmed up. But, the 2nd one-oh brother. Somebody get the hook. This guy was so lame, it was a struggle to laugh out loud. I guess I wanted to laugh loud enough to justify the money I spent here and that just wasn't going to happen.\\n \\nThe headliner was Rocky LaPort & ok, this guy was frikkin' hilarious. He was so funny that eventually I couldn't even get the laughs out anymore. \\n\\nI'm going to sum it up here: 1 guy moderately funny, 1 guy who just plain sucked, and 1 guy who was hilarious. Cost of the 10:30 show: $57. Length of show 60 min. No kidding. $57 for a 1 hour show. It didn't take long for me to wish I'd spent my Vegas entertainment money on something else. This show was so bad and since I'd already had one bad experience there, I have to assume that all the shows are bad and hence, one star.\\n\\nI will never return to The Improv anywhere.

    "). \\n\\nWe ordered 2 bowls of the house specialty pho and the pan fried seafood noodles. Everything was SO good. The noodles were fried into a bowl shape and had a lot of shrimp, squid, fish, and an abundance of veggies (which I love). When you smash the fried noodles & stir it up with the seafood sauce, they turn into half crunchy/half tender noodles. The consistency was so good that I barely got a couple of bites in before my kids gobbled it all up. The pho was pretty good with the meat all very tender and not chewy (like when you just chew so much and force yourself to swallow because it's not falling apart enough, no, that never happened). The broth was good, although I tend to just take a preliminary taste before I dress it up with japalenos, lime, sriricha, and hoisen sauce. \\n\\nThe second time we went back was on Mother's Day at about 6PM. There were only 3 other tables there? I was wondering if I had missed something & if this place was closed down by the health district or something prior to our visit. Hopefully not. This time around, we ordered boba milk tea (75% ice, stop being so stingy), and the same order as last time + spring rolls. The spring rolls are standard, but served with extra lettuce to wrap around the spring rolls. Sure, I'm down to eat extra lettuce whenever I can, although others may not like it. The pho was the same as last time, but the seafood noodles were different. They had beef in them and bbq pork. It was lacking most of the seafood in the \\\"crispy pan fried seafood noodles\\\", and just tasted way different. I'm going to go again and order all the same stuff and decide if I should keep this spot on my radar. I wish the food was more consistent, but for now, I'll say it's alright.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

We walked in on a quiet Thursday night with the place practically deserted. We were not greeted nor asked to place an order, we just kinda rolled up to the register and \\\"said can we order now\\\", and the girl said sure! We order two (2) simple cheese steak sandwiches with fries. We must have waited over 20 mins  but still no food but we noticed how many people were picking up their food to go. I asked why customers waiting inside the restaurant were being delayed while orders were passing us by?   Needless to say, after another few mins the food was served  but on a TWO DAY OLD BREAD and meat that looked like it had been recycled. I could't est it and received my money back. We went across the street to Barros Pizza and was very happy with the service and meal.

I also lived in Japan for 12 years and am half Japanese and for me, Monta is a part of home. Yes it's small but that's part of the charm. Don't expect to come here and spend a lot of time conversations with family or friends you bring either. It's a quick in and out type of place so go in knowing that and respect the line of people waiting to be seated. It has a very simple but good menu with the classic of any good ramen shop. Ramen noodles, with different bases, toppings to add and gyoza and fried rice are a must also. Enjoy! I come here often and have been coming here since they opened.

Now I'm having to give it 2 stars. Our last 3 trips to this location have just been awful. The first of our awful trips we both got the Surf and Turf burger. I ordered mine medium and she ordered hers medium rare. Both came crispy and far from pink. Needless to say we sent them back. I got mine first somehow and waited for hers to come thinking it would be any second. It wasn't...by the time she got hers mine was cold! Making a long story short I complained to head quarters and we received a gift card to go back and try it again. We did and unfortunately it was the same experience with different food. We went through the whole process yet again and gave it one last try...I'm sorry to say other than going for the beer selection I won't be eating at that location any longer.

My only other particular problem is they have no wait staff at the bar area, at least not late, I've never been there before midnight, it's a minor thing but really, I don't want to walk to the bar every time I want a drink or some fries, I've had a hard night. \\n   The good news is that the rooms are awesome, I love the modern/retro blend and think the big tubs with \\\"mood lighting\\\" and the ridiculous shower heads are amazing. The grounds are beautiful with bright green grass everywhere and the layout and design of most of the hotel are straight out of a Rat Pack how to book. The beds are super comfy and the original buildings have balconies with lounge chairs. \\n   Even with some negatives, even with a valet staff that flat out lies to me, even with a fairly high price, I love coming here and look forward to every opportunity.

    "### Input:\nThe Stone Rose at the Fairmont Princess is the 5th Gerber Group lounge I've been to.  I used to frequent one all the time in Boston and I was just at the Stone Rose in NY last month.  The inside part of the bar looks pretty much just like every other Gerber lounge.  There is actually more light in there than the others.  The menu is exactly the same and just like the other locations, the bartenders here can't make a good mojito.  And because they are mainly based in NY and LA expect NY and LA prices. \\n\\nWhat makes this particular lounge different is the large outside bar.  Well, I suppose the Whiskey in Vegas has that too but there is an overwhelming \\\"resort\\\" feel here that you don't get at the other locations.  They are clearly nightspots.  This is clearly a resort bar.  Not that there is anything wrong with that, but you can expect to see kids in pj's hanging out. Then you have people who are there for weddings so they are dressed for that....and you have your tourists in plaid shorts and Tevas.  So it ends up being an interesting mix. Also, because of the resort feel the music isn't quite the same, its more laid back.  \\n\\nThe service is super friendly which is always appreciated.

We ordered lettuce wraps and egg rolls as appetizers. The apps were both good, however when we asked for extra lettuce, we only got one more piece, seemed a little stingy. The chicken fried rice was terrible, and the vegetables used were from a frozen bag of veggies (you can tell by the cube-cut carrots). I ordered 3 rolls of sushi, some of the smallest rolls/pieces I have ever seen. The worst part is when we got the bill, $80 and the rolls were not 50% off. When we asked the waitress about it, she said we had to sit at the sushi bar in order to get the 50% off. How shady can a place be?

I ate two of them and decided I had a little bit too much self respect for anymore. The place has a decent atmosphere aside from the random decorations that don't fit in the least.

    "### Input:\nMatt's Big Breakfast was super busy this weekend before Christmas so I turned to yelp trying to find something good that I haven't had before and this place popped up and decided to give it a try for breakfast.\\n\\nIt's located right next to the Bimbo bread factory when I got out of the car it smelt like fresh baked goodness.\\n\\nGoing inside the decor was what I expected for a Chinese American Mexican restaurant. Service was rather friendly, but that's where all things good end. We ordered a waffle combo and biscuits and gravy. I should have thought twice about ordering food after constantly hearing the microwave alarm sound. The food was lame, not bad, but really disappointing. Maybe something you'd expect at a truck stop diner. Throughout our meal I probably heard the microwave alarm go off about 20 times even though there were only 6 people in the restaurant. I was baffled.\\n\\nOn the way out I got what they called a pineapple fruit water, which really is a Mexican agua de pi\\u00f1a. It was well done, fresh made and quite delicious. If I'm going to go back I would give the Mexican food a try, although I wouldn't be surprised if it is just microwave cuisine.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

Toto, we're not on the Strip anymore.\\n\\nWe came here on a recommendation from a friend, and was one of the reasons we came downtown in the first place. \\n\\nWe started with the fried mushrooms that were tasty and PLENTIFUL, at a great price. When we found out the soup was New England clam chowder, my husband HAD to order it for the sheer curiosity factor of how they would do clam chowder in the desert. The answer: Not well. There were carrots?? in it, and it was so thin. The taste wasn't bad, but   doesn't get the Bostonian seal of approval.\\n\\nMy husband had the fish and chips which were HUGE, and the cole slaw was actually really tasty. He said the fish was great, not greasy or heavy. I had a cheeseburger, and it was solid. I had onion rings with it, and they were solid but a little too much breading.\\n\\nI had the Hefeweizen and it was AWESOME, and a huge glass was less than 4 bucks.

This woman was rude the entire time, and I actually considered driving to the next Payless in the middle of my transaction just to avoid her bad attitude.  I understand having a bad day, but I felt she was very unprofessional (whiny and childish, even), though she seemed to be in charge of a lot at the store.  At several points she put her hands to her head, elbows on the register, not looking at me, repeating that she didn't understand, and using a calculator to \\\"figure out what was going on\\\".  I've never had this problem at Payless; the receipts are usually pretty clear on what was purchased and how much goes back on my card.

    "### Input:\nI was here for dinner at the Schenke Restaurant in the basement during Oktoberfest. The decor and furniture though not fancy is authentic and has a German feel to it. The servers and staff were in dirndl dresses and were very polite and warm. The buffet hall had pretty good service and the food although had very limited variety was delicious. The pork schnitzel was tender on the inside and crispy outside. The sausages were to die for. The constant flow of beer was personally appreciated and I enjoyed the apple strudel for desert was perfect. And we got a surprise shot of schnapps at the end of it all.

    "GAIN!\\n\\nSo I park my car around the back and make my way to the lobby. I have yet to walk 5 feet when a homeless dude just comes out of nowhere and asks if I have any change I can spare. I tell him im married. Lol. He just looks at me like wtf? So I continue on. This time I am able to walk about 20 feet before I see another homeless dude pissing on the wall. That explains the piss smell that everybody on here is mentioning in their reviews.\\n\\nSo I finally make it to the waiting lobby. I find out that the bus my friend is on is gonna be late about an hour. Great. Can't really go back to my car and do much with an hour so I decided to stay in the lobby. Big Mistake.\\n\\nI gotta give a shout out to the security guys and gals that have to force themselves to come work here because for the next 60 minutes, you got crackheads walkin around asking for money, prostitutes tryin to get some work in, their pimp walkin around makin sure they get their money, (I think it's the same guy strung out on crack. Great, a pimp that's a crack addict), and young punks that are probably lookin to sell their \\\"stuff\\\". The security guys are walking around the whole time making sure these \\\"shady\\\" people go on their merry way. Of course they have to leave them alone if they say they are waiting for their party to arrive. \\n\\nFinally, after about an hour and a half later, my friend shows up. Instead of giving him a hug and a how are you I said, \\\"Next time, pay the extra cash to fly or rent a car cuz im not coming back here!\\\" \\n\\nAs soon as I got home, I quickly jumped in the shower for fear of contracting some unknown disease just by hanging out in the lobby for 90 minutes.\\n\\nSo yeah.

    "### Input:\nUpon entering the salon I found it uncomfortable to breath.  Maybe it isn't well ventilated for the amount of work they do? The air feels full of powder and fumes.  I sat and the man working on my nails was doing okay removing the gel polish and making repairs to my natural nails that were all cracked. Then it happened... He cut two of my nails significantly shorter than the rest!   I let him know politely.  And eventually he got up and had someone else take over.  These are my real nails, and I was not going to be happy with them applying acrylics because of this mistake.  I liked the length on the rest of my nails which I so patiently grew out myself.  In the end I went home with UNEVEN lengths.  The lady who took over was far more personable.  Unfortunately with his mistake... It was all too late.  I told her to even them out.  After going home I see she evened out my right hand to match all the shorter cut nails. My left hand remained all longer. SUPER DISAPPOINTED about this. I was very calm and polite too. I chose a pale pink glitter gel and a teal glitter for my ring fingers.  Painted in a high French.  She did a good job applying the gel.  $50 with tip. The way he cut my nails is obviously uneven and just ruined it for me.  Now I have to file them down myself and seal the edges with gel polish on my own.  Such a hassle.  On top of that, wait for my nails to grow to the length I wanted!  I would prefer the salons that take their time, pay more attention to detail, that have a more comfortable environment to relax in.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

And my friend got the equivalent of three turkey club sandwiches in their turkey club.

    "-hand side with red and white decor, there was a couple in the more intimate left-hand side, not sure what the difference is to get seated there.\\n\\nStarted with the Hiromaru buns as an appetizer- quite nice, with doughy buns and plentiful portions of pork and special sauce. I quite liked the almost barbecue-like sauce that the pork was cooked in.\\n\\nCarbonara ramen for myself, black garlic for my guy.\\nI was pleasantly surprised by my dish- was a little apprehensive, thinking the broth would be thicker and create a texture I did not like (not a fan of alfredo sauces) but somehow it worked, being milky and flavorful without being too decadent or overly rich (though it was). Did not specify thick noodles as I initially would have preferred, but received thin and appreciated the similarity to spaghetti carbonara, added to the fusion feel of the dish overall. The bacon and fresh-ground pepper really made this dish, adding just a bit of bite to the flavor and a meaty savory element that balanced out the milky broth. And I'm not even a bacon fan! \\nMy guy favored his garlic ramen- I took a few bites and it wasn't really for me, flavors were bold but seemed a little off. He has had less ramen but proclaimed that it was his favorite bowl so far, which is impressive. Egg was a bit overcooked, but overall the dish was tasty but just slightly off and almost felt incomplete, like something was missing.\\n\\nI will say that, despite the giant bowls and the rich broths, the ramen did not feel like an overwhelmingly heavy dinner- perhaps it has to do with the choice for thin noodles? A big bowl of ramen is good comfort food to me, but I liked not feeling the sloshing-belly-full-of-dinner feeling afterward. Would come back to try the other milk-broth ramen with ham.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "lived on the Summerlin side of town for a long time to see this actual building rotate though a former life of being many different restaurants/bars over many years, I think there might be a recipe with this new Distill that might make it stick.  \\n\\nUnlike prior restaurants/bars in the same space who really never changed it up so much, the decor and design has changed just so to make it feel and look brand new and that time and consideration was put into this remodel.  It is still built on a round center bar, but they have knocked down enough walls, put up enough brick and done enough design changes to make it feel welcoming and different.  \\n\\nPretty expansive menu considering it is basically a bar (which includes breakfast 24/7, which I personally found to be a big bonus), what I thought to be reasonably priced and many nooks/spots to sit and hunker down to meet with friends, it seems like a good \\\"local spot.\\\"  Often in Vegas, we (or maybe me) look to restaurants/bars that are unique/have an edge/have a niche, when indeed to great solid, basic staple with nice staff, good food and a nice atmosphere.  Although there is nothing earth shattering or noteworthy to say \\\"this place is awesome\\\" (although there are pool tables in the back),  I still enjoyed going and will absolutely go back.  As it advertises wanting to be a local hangout, I think they might be on to something and being a local in the Summerlin area, I will go back.  \\n\\nCurious about the smoking policy, for the nice hostess indicated that you could smoke anywhere and I saw only one person smoking who was sitting at the bar.   With people eating everywhere and NV law, not sure the hostess was correct.  I am not a smoker and a \\\"you can smoke anywhere\\\" bar would surely be the only thing that would turn me off about this place.  Again, I did not grill the nice hostess any further, although would clarify when I am in there again.  \\n\\nMaybe it is indeed my new local hangout.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "### Input:\nI had my LASIK consultation today.  I waited in the waiting room for about 30 minutes prior to being taken back by the \\\"Director of the Center\\\".  She took me in a room and did a quick \\\"test\\\" on my eyes and then brought me to another room, sat me down and asked if I had any questions about the procedure.  I said I had numerous questions, but would prefer to speak to the surgeon (No need asking them twice, since I really only cared about what the surgeon had to say).  She said asking her my questions/concerns was \\\"one in the same\\\".  I think not.  That was the first red flag.  The second one came after she said I would not be meeting the surgeon at all prior to the day of surgery.  Who in their right mind agrees to an elective surgery without meeting the surgeon prior to the day of surgery?  I have never heard of such a thing!  I'm assuming after you pay in full you are then allowed to meet the surgeon.  The third and final red flag came after she said she would schedule me an appointment with the surgeon at another time and then revoked that offer, saying \\\"We just don't do that here.\\\"   I got up and left.  This place is obviously a LASIK factory mill and I'm not willing to put my eyes at risk to save a few bucks. Beware.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "### Input:\n2 stars because many of the people and the dogs that I've met here have been awesome and super friendly.  However, I would give the actual dog park zero stars.  There is no shade whatsoever here, so the only times I can come are at dawn, dusk, or if it happens to be cloudy.  Otherwise my dog overheats!  Plus there are no lights here so I can't bring him after dark when it's cool.  It's not landscaped so it's basically just a big fenced off field.  There are 2 areas, one for small dogs, and one for large dogs, however people bring their large dogs into the small dog area.  Even if they're not aggressive, if they are a big dog I think they should be in the big dog area. My poor little dog gets scared with these giant dogs running around him.\\n\\nI'll probably continue to go here since I live so close, but definitely don't go out of your way to bring your dog here.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

It was super hot!  But it was so good.  The sauce was best paired with the craw fish.  The juice from the shrimp does not take as well, but if you peel the shrimp and then plunge the entire body into the sauce in the bag, then you are good to go with the awesome hot n juicy and very garlicky flavor.  You must love butter, you must love garlic, and you must be able to handle spicy.  \\n\\nThis place is pretty good, and comparable to Boiling Crab in the Bay Area, maybe even better in my opinion.

    "my book, a great find. I'm happy to say that the DJ at Lava Lounge is just as good, and for that, we will definitely keep coming back to dance.\\n\\nTo drink?  Well, that's a different issue.  I understand that this is the South Side, but the bartenders use teeny tiny measuring cups for your mixed drinks, meaning that you end up with less than a full shot of booze in each $4.50 drink.  Personality-wise, the bartenders are usually great: friendly, and good at handling the crowd that will all turn up at one time for the next round during an 'off' song.  I haven't been on any other night besides 80s Night, so who knows if this is just something they do when they're super crowded. Thankfully, I will dance to 80s music without a single drop of booze, so I manage pretty well :)\\n\\nMy only other issue with the Lava Lounge is that they could definitely use more space in the back dance area. It gets SO crowded by the end of the night (which, good for them, we want a rockin' 80s Night to stick around!), and I wish there was some way they could expand a bit. I realize this isn't possible, so just take it as a heads-up that you will be sweaty and dancing with people you've never met before because of space constraints before the end of the night.\\n\\nOther than that, and the fact that you *do* have to deal with a few annoying typical South Side-rs (although there are quite a few former Upstage kids who come here now), this is a great 80s Night.  The DJ plays a ton of new wave and 80s pop. He throws in a Bon Jovi or Journey song here and there, but the majority of the setlist is made up of The Cure, Depeche Mode, Prince, Madonna, New Order, and similar bands.

    "### Input:\nThis is a great place, although it looks unassuming from the outside (it's located in a strip mall just off the Strip). It has been open since 1958 and has a really great \\\"rat pack\\\" feel to it, which is appropriate considering Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Elvis, etc. came here often. Each table has a plaque behind it with a celebrity name of someone who dined at that spot; we sat at the Mickey Rooney table. Service is very professional with career waiters in tuxedos. One waiter has been there for 30 years. I had the prime rib, which is their specialty (they have a number of other beef cuts too). It was the best prime rib I have ever had...about an inch and a quarter thick and big. You will find a lot of classic steak house dishes here...tomato & blue cheese salad, creamed spinach, french onion soup, etc. All are very tasty and far more than routine. Most salads and desserts are made at your table by the waiters. The place has a very grown up vibe, not really a place for kids. Although there were a couple of people dining in shorts and t-shirts, I would advise guests to get in the spirit of the place; grow up and dress up! It's not cheap; prime rib alone is $35, add on all sides, appetizers & drinks, etc. Lobster and filet mignon combo was listed that night at $95. That said, I felt the experience was well worth it.

    "500 sq ft of the regular deluxe room) in February for Memorial Day Weekend (yes..3 freakin months in advance), knowing prices were going to go ridiculously high as MDW got closer. Once arriving on Saturday, after waiting in a ridiculously long and slow moving line in the lobby, I checked-in thinking everything was a-ok. Too bad once I arrived to the room, I was shocked by how small it was. Um...this definitely CANNOT be a suite--one, it only had 1 bathroom, no separate kitchen, and everything was much more cramped than what I remembered in the pictures online. I called the front desk to see if there was a mistake and of course, they put us in the wrong room. \\n\\nSo giving them the benefit of the doubt and knowing MDW is one of Vegas' busiest weekends, I figured it was a small mistake and they could move us to our actual room quickly. Too bad they end up telling us because it is MDW, they completely sold out of rooms and OVERBOOKED so they had no choice but to DOWNGRADE us into a smaller room. Apparently, hotwire or expedia sold more Vdara rooms than they had available, so in order to accommodate those rooms, they kicked a few of us who  actually BOOKED ON VDARA'S WEBSITE into their regular rooms. \\n\\nTo compensate for this \\\"mistake\\\" they did offer us $100 room service credit and $60 off our two-night stay (which wasn't much of a discount considering we booked it 3 months ahead--so our room was already cheap to begin with and they were going off the current-day rates) but ONLY after we complained and made them realize they put us in the wrong room. To think they weren't even going to tell us they managed to downgrade our reservation, until we walked in and realized something was off about our initial room, is ridiculous.\\n\\nI heard good things about Vdara and had high hopes for a good stay here, but unfortunately I will not be coming back.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "### Input:\nThe human body is so fascinating!!! This exhibition is definitely worth checking out. You get to see the human body in a way you've never seen before. And yes it is all real body parts. They use a special preserving technique to keep everything in tact. Each room is dedicated to a certain part of the body. There's the skeletal room, circulatory, digestive, respiratory and there's even a room for fetal development. Each display has a description so you know what you are looking at and what the function is. The circulatory room was the most interesting because you don't realize how many veins and arteries you have in your body until you see it right in front of you. The room that made me sad was the fetal development room because you realize that those were once living fetuses and never had a chance in life.

    "### Input:\nI finally got to stay here after using my MyVegas Slots points. I only had to pay $28 for the resort fee. Check-in was quick. The receptionist was nice and upgraded us to 2 beds for no extra charge. The lobby had strawberry and pineapple infused water\\n\\nWe had the standard room with 2 queen beds. The bathroom was spacious with bright lights around the mirror. The automatic shades consisted of \\\"sheer\\\" as well as \\\"black-out\\\", which is a must if you want good quality sleep well into the afternoon after a long, fun, wild night. The TV remote was horrible. The signal lagged or something. \\n\\nThe casino itself is huge. The elevators are fairly easy to find though. It's a pain when you have to walk deep into the casino from the lobby just to get to the elevator (like Mirage and Planet Hollywood)\\n\\nThe food court is not bad. You can find some cheap, quick food to eat and avoid the high end restaurants. They need to add a Jamba Juice though\\n\\nThe pool is a bit of a walk to the back of the hotel, but it's nice. They have some regular pools as well as a lazy river\\n\\nWifi is free IF you have a hotel room. They deactivate it soon after you check out\\n\\nI would definitely stay here again if the price is right. Though it is usually higher than what i want to pay. I guess it's worth it if you're going to see a fight or show here\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "the parking garage elevators without wanting to shower afterwards. In bleach.\\n\\nResort Fees.\\n\\nAh, Las Vegas has finally found a way to screw guests out of more money while showing a lower price per night. You are now commanded to pay a $20 resort fee which allows you to use the pool and, allegedly, gain some internet access (which is limited to one device and limited in time). It's heinous, dishonest and vile way to extract more money from guests and yes, every property does it. Yes, it is mandatory, just $20 or more to the price of every hotel you look at.\\n\\nAt one time the Flamingo was one of the values on the strip. That said, any \\\"renovation\\\" or \\\"updating\\\" the Flamingo claims is taking place wasn't evident to us. The carpets in the hallways are 14 years old or more (we know, we were here when they were new). The same carpets are stained and in my places coming up from the floor or even openly torn making luggage hauling, or just walking, a little more exciting.\\n\\nWe check in at 4pm on a Tuesday. We waited about half an hour, which didn't seem totally unreasonable but was, in no way, pleasant.\\n\\nA small child attempted some impromptu breakdancing and yelling on the floor next to us which was somewhat entertaining but who in the hell wants their small child rolling around on a casino floor which, by the way, managed to get the child's feet black as coal. This is important because moments later the father of the child, now at the front counter, picked the filthy kid up and put him, yes, on the counter, where his nasty feet ran back and forth. On. The. Counter. Yes, where your hands go when you sign in.

    "### Input:\nIt's true that Lee's isn't going to serve you the best bahn mi that is known to man, but what they offer up is reasonably-priced, consistently good sandwiches on fresh baked bread. They are always open, so if you are like me - traveling to Las Vegas from the East Coast with a sleep schedule that's completely out-of-whack - Lee's is an option whenever I find myself craving a good Vietnamese sandwich or in need of something to eat which isn't a couple of eggs and toast or run-of-the-mill fast food. \\n\\nI've also been enjoying their coconut \\\"smoothie\\\", which is much more like a milkshake than anything remotely healthy as one would expect a smoothie to be. The packaged goods they offer are interesting enough to experiment with; I tend to get one or two cookie or hard candy packages each visit to save for later. \\n\\nService is mediocre at best, but it's adequate. I think they do their best given the drunken crowd which shows up past 11PM which is either elated to be fed cheap or obnoxious and too wasted to even remember their visit the next day.

    "ebriated drunkards basking in the sun while sipping on endless amount of booze come into play!\\n\\nMarquee is deemed to be THE spot to pool party. However, I think Encore and WET Republic take the cake. Here are my gripes:\\n\\nSmall pool to splash around and sparse accommodations to any of your belongings, yet alone, leave it with a large pile of other people's belongings. Hence, bottle service gives you a small space to party like a rockstar with your friends and soon-to-be friends and leave your stuff hanging around. The service is baffling!! My friend orders us bottle service and pitchers of more alcohol to go around with our group, but to our own dismay, the little monster shuffling her small frame and fake boobs in our faces was utterly rude! She wanted us to pay first before we got our drinks?! WOW!! My friend paid for everything, called his credit card company to cancel the transaction, voila!, we got our FREE booze in hand!! Boo-yah!\\n\\nThe crowd was so-so. I've seen better eye candy at Encore and WR. A group of guys tried their best to fondle me and my girlfriends thinking I wouldn't say one word. I NEVER take that kind of advantage from ANYBODY! Security was shamefully nonchalant about the incident and scurried off thinking it was no big deal. Really?! After much avoidance and drinking plenty of vodka shots and AMFs, I was dancing like nuts to the filtering sounds of house music!\\n\\nI really want to give this place more than what it should be credited for but I find it disappointing when I receive lack of service from anybody. I enjoyed the hours of incredible music, my awesome set of company, and what was little to be known, an okay venue. Is it worth it to come back again? Depends.

    "of weeks ago as part of my honeymoon. The check-in line was long and kinda dragged, which is why I gave it 4 stars. Everything else was great. \\n\\nThe lady checking us in upgraded our room for free since we mentioned we were on our honeymoon. We got a spa room, which is just a room with a hot tub in it. I LOVED the view from the room! We were on the 33rd floor with a great view of the strip. The bed was comfortable, the hot tub was great and I loved the fact that there weren't a lot of rooms on our floor. We didn't hear much activity up there and felt like we had the whole floor to ourselves. \\n\\nWe ate at a few different places while we were there. We knew to stay away from America since a lot of people got sick there, according to a few reviews. I tried the buffalo wings and fries from the Sportsbar restaurant (I can't recall the name). The wings were ok but instead of dipping the wings in the buffalo sauce, they cooked them in it so they came out a bit dry. Still pretty good if you dip them in ranch. The fries were really good! We had one order of the regular fries and one order of the parmesan fries. Get the regular fries. My husband got the sliders. They were ok. \\n\\nWe then tried a place that was famous for it's burgers. I can't recall the name of this place either but you can't miss it since it's around the same area as the Sportsbar place and they literally have all kinds of burgers. It's their thing. I really liked that place. The burgers were good!! The service there was awesome.

The three other times I have visited, I have had a pleasant experience, but it seems that this is going a little bit downhill. \\n\\nThe Good: It has a very \\\"safe\\\" menu. It's very American friendly and the menu is in English and not in Vietnamese (some of the dishes have Vietnamese names). It has pretty good ambience.

The fish did not have a grilled appearance or taste and was a bit mushy.  Super lame pre-shredded cheese at this spot detracts from the quality as well as gross chips & nasty tortillas.\\n\\nThe same day I went here I went to happy hour at crescent ballroom and had amazzzzing fish tacos for $2 each that had flaky seasoned real grilled fish not this limp frozen mush.  I didn't realized how gross it was until 5 hours later at happy hour.

The service is absolutely atrocious.  I believe employees should have fun where they work, but these kids took it to a new level.  Many of the employees were horseplaying, and were therefore very inattentive.  We sat in the dining room far from the front counter and could hear the employees yelling and singing very loudly (and badly).  Again, I don't mind employees having fun, but not at the expense of some degree of professionalism.

I was expecting a typical greasy, Chinese experience, but what I got was so much better.\\n\\nTang's is much like a Pei Wei, you choose the dish that you want, the type of protein, the type of rice and it is all done at the counter.\\n\\nThe inside is sleek and very clean, and they have one TV hanging on the wall that was tuned into Sportscenter (bonus points there).  Our food was out in a flash, and it looked divine.\\n\\nMy dining companion got the Chinese Chicken salad and said it was the best one she had every had.  They used a combination of different leafy lettuces, including spinach, so it felt very hearty.  It was  lightly dressed with an Asian vinaigrette and some fried won ton chips.\\n\\nI opted for the orange chicken with brown rice, and I was happy to find that they don't up-charge you for brown rice like many places do.  My dish had chicken, carrots and snow peas all in a sweet & spicy orange sauce, it was excellent.  The best part was that instead of giant chunks of chicken, the chicken was cut into thin slices, making it easier to eat.  The brown rice was cooked perfectly, and was very fluffy.\\n\\nWe both commented as to how much we really liked Tang's, and if I am in the area around a mealtime again, I would surely go back.\\n\\nAs for the complaints about pricing I have seen on here, the prices are no different than Pei Wei and maybe even a bit less. (P.S. Pei Wei doesn't have \\\"lunch specials\\\" either)  The portions were quite large, neither of us could even finish, and the quality made it worth it.

    "ended up being the case! \\n\\nWe ordered guacamole, chips and salsa, the trio bocadito ( may be the name of the app), two kids slider meals, 1 kids quesadilla, smoked brisket enchiladas, and the short rib barbacoa. \\n\\nThe guacamole app was the initial warning enforce the storm! Call me 730 coocoo but they used to offer the guacamole trio... Not anymore . What ev! So the guacamole was ok, but I needed more salt, there was none. (Can't you just not stand when a restaurant fees the food s so on point that salt and pep are not needed. . Well exsqueeze me for having such a palate) the salsas were ok. My fave was the red one.. Salt would have helped. Also not sure what was up with the chips but they were chewy as the first review stated. On to the main dishes. To begin, when do kids sliders resemble three hamburgers from McDonald's, minus the fact that they're served medium!!! What kid eats a medium burger?? 14$ down the drain. The cheese quesadilla was inedible smothered in cheese, I couldn't let my son (10 months) risk that cardiac attack so i sent it back! The beef short rib ish was flavorful, but the meat wasn't as tender as it could have been! It made it a bit rough to enjoy. The smoked brisket was ok also, just a king a bit in flavor. \\n\\nI feel this day coulda just been a clusterfracked day for them being it was opening day. Waaaay too many people in your grill when your eating, food just not up to par. Prices for quality ratio out of wack!

    "and the Marquee Day Club Pool. The hotel checks for room keys for entry into the pool level. It is open 7 days, 8 am to 8 pm.\\n\\nThe layout: The Boulevard Pool consists of the main pool, a small wading pool, and a small heated pool. The main pool slopes gradually from very shallow (2\\\" deep) water to deeper water (~4-1/2'). It is surrounded by padded lounge chairs and a few cabanas. On higher surrounding decks and by the wading pool, there are additional lounge chairs. A small recreation area is adorned with a wall of TV screens, some chairs, and two pool tables. Nearby is the Overlook Grill. Medium-loud Top 40 style music sets the ambiance. For a hotel this size, it's a rather small pool.\\n\\nThe view: The pool is on the east end of the hotel, overlooking The Strip. When you're  in the water, mostly you are looking at Paris, Planet Hollywood, the giant LCD screen running Cosmopolitan ads, and the East Tower of The Cosmopolitan.\\n\\nLaying out in the sun: At noon on a Thursday in June, the pool wasn't that busy, though all of the lounge chairs by the main pool were already taken/saved. A number of lounge chairs were still free by the wading pool and on the upper decks. (The chairs are already looking worn, and many have cigarette burns.)

If you are looking for sun at that time, try the Bamboo Pool.\\n\\nThe service: Since it was a chill weekday when I arrived, I didn't have too much trouble ordering a drink from one of the roaming servers.

    "### Input:\nFor an UO, it's not bad. It's geared toward students of course so the selection isn't as \\\"edgy\\\" as one might hope. Plenty of nice stuff at prices that won't totally break the bank. Hipster-y, yes, but it also fills in the gap that Marrakech, Paris' Boutique, etc. have tried (and failed) to fill over the years. As campus is waaaay far from the Goodwill and even downtown Champaign is a considerable trek, UO gets points for sheer convenience. They're open til 9pm most nights so if there's an emergency run for shoes / date threads / a dress for whatever formal stuff goes on in college, UO is a pretty safe bet and it's closer than the mall.\\n\\nThe staff is very sweet and helpful, the store is kept organized and the sale section is a permanent fixture. \\n\\nAnd the big upside for the skint populus is that a lot of used UO clothing will land itself in our local Goodwill for a pretty nice price.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

Their only complaint was that they did not like one of the dressings, luckily they had it on the side.\\nFor dessert we tried an array of cookies! The chocolate chip sea salt was good, but there was too much salt on them. The butterscotch oat cookies were probably my favorite, I love butterscotch.

    "ed, but we never had trouble finding parking.  And all the parking spots are very close to the lobby door, so you never had to be in the sun very long (especially since it was 110 all week.)  The room was old and outdated, but clean.  The master bed was soft but okay, but the pull out couch was horrible - they really shouldn't advertise this as a 4-person room when the pull out couch looks like it's about to fall over and leaves spring marks in your back.  The A/C worked well in the front room, but we never felt any air in the bedroom.  Complimentary wifi was a nice touch, but only worked in one or two spots in the room - good luck finding them!  There was no deadbolt or chain on the door.  The shower was also a joke - we called it the impaler because it had 2 spray modes: one that was a jet blast of water, like you'd clean the seams in your driveway, and another that had 4 or 5 of those jet blasts.  Least relaxing shower EVER!  I hear they're performing a remodel, so maybe it'll be more updated soon.  Had my car battery die in the parking lot while we were here, so I asked the front desk for a jump.  It was close to \\\"shift change\\\", so no one was allowed to leave their desks (maintenance either - they have desks?) until shift change was completed.  Could be 30-60 minutes!  I found a fellow guest who helped me out, but not before I hung outside 15 minutes in the 110 degree heat.  It's okay - a local drug dealer who found some shade in front of the lobby chatted me up about how he just got off probation (I guess shift change made it impossible to chase off the local riff raff either - at least he was friendlier to me than the desk staff.)  We probably won't be back - too spoiled from our usual timeshare at Tahiti Village.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "Even better is their cooking tools section (where you can buy huge tamale steamers, and mortar and pestles for making chile) and the catering menu which starts at $5 per person.  Holy crap.  What a steal.  \\n\\nUpon entrance you'll see the deep pit outside where some man is grilling all the carne you'll find served inside.  As you step inside you'll see some brisk business - I found all sorts of types and ethnicities here - a young couple on a date, some girls gabbing over lunch and others ordering food and pastries to go.\\n\\nThe food here ROCKS.   It's very authentic, cooked by commadres and tias just like back home.   The Grandma quotient on the beans and rice was very high -- always a standard assessment in my quest for good Mexican food.  They have every imaginable burrito type here and they're huge and cheap - at $4.  I always opt for the veggie (rice, beans, cheese and guacamole) burrito and am always impressed - the best part being the freshly made tortillas.  I even bought some on my way out to take home.\\n\\nThe tacos are a good choice too.  The combo plates start at $5.  The carne asada (a little overcooked) was pretty good and delicious in a flavorful marinade, and the shrimp taco was really good - a much better choice I would add.  Paired with some tamarind, strawberry agua fresca or horchata and you'll be in heaven.\\n\\nI find the bakery to be the highlight regarding the food.  The pandulce was excellent - if a bit more fresh (than Ranch Market) given the way it's stored behind a glass case rather than self-service.  The conchas and pineapple empanadas were soft, sweet and delicious - with perfect texture.

Perfect food if you're hungover and very reasonably priced.\\n\\nStaff were very friendly and they all spoke English which was helpful for someone who speaks no French.

The size of the salad was on the medium side, slightly larger than a side salad...I felt like it was missing a bread stick or something.  I skipped on the $2 avocado option because the salad price was already $9 and some change...I quickly looked up the place on yelp and asked the server about the Yelp Oct. special and he said he didn't know anything about it.  Aside from my poor selection of that specific salad for lunch this is a cool downtown spot with easy parking, I have seen crowds here on the weekends and at first Fridays so I will be back to try something different...but they could have gone a whole other level with the salad toppings (chopped or carved turkey vs. cold sliced turkey and the bacon didn't seem like it was apple wood smoked or thick cut or anything special....just bacon like you get at any old place like Denny's.  Maybe I'm getting old haha, I just don't expect to spend over $12 on a quick lunch (tax + tip), I love a good lunch time special that gives me a meal (bonus points if it's on the healthy side) with a drink for under $10 tax and tip included...I know you're thinking good luck but aside from Fast Food places there are several out there.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

I was really upset and filed a report. Unfortunately, once it's lost, it's gone forever. There's close to zero chance of recovering it.  I found out who cleaned the room that day and approached her the next day, but of course she kept repeating the same words - No Bracelet. No, I don't know.   \\n\\nOf course, it's my fault too for leaving a valuable jewelry out on the counter, but it never crossed my mind that someone would actually steal stuff from my hotel room. \\nIronically, I met an older couple in the elevator that very evening, and the husband said that their room got broken into that morning, and someone had somehow opened up their safe and taken over $10K worth of their personal belongings. They didn't seem like a couple that would make up a story like that. But one things' for sure.

This place is perfect for a 3 am grub session after hitting those crazy clubs all night or even just for a plain and simple breakfast at 8 am. All-in-all you just can't beat those prices AND portions.\\n\\nI've been here a couple times and I ALWAYS get the $5.99 steak and eggs special. It's not included in the menu but it's usually written on their chalkboard sign by the front of the cafe. The special comes with 2 eggs (any way you want it), 6 oz. sirloin steak (cooked any way you want it), home fries and toast. The portions are perfect and I never had a problem with the chefs over or under-cooking the meat. Plus, those home fries are so deliciously crisp and well-seasoned. For $5.99 what's to complain about?\\n\\nSIDE NOTE: the special is only from 11 pm to 11 am. Other than that, everything is great! \\n\\nSo please stop by this place whenever you're in Vegas. If you're going to spend $80 on drinks at the Marquee or Tao, might as well treat yourself to the tastiest, cheapest breakfast they got.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "### Input:\nDon't have any big expectations whenever you eat here.  Babbo's is neighborhood bistro, which means to me that they would be half a step above take out.  I've only eaten here twice and I've ordered a different pasta each time.  While food is nothing to write home about, the appetizers were creative and even incorporated Mid-East (hummus dip) and asian elements.  The food prices were reasonable and the kids portions were generous.  I wish they would expand their dessert menu since it only has three items.\\n\\nNevertheless, I HATE dining in here because of the wait staff.\\n\\nI get it -- the wait staff is young, polite, and accomodating.  Then, they say/do something completely asinine that leaves you with such a horrible overall impression of this place.  The last time I dined inside there were annoying flies.   The waitress gave us an apology and a weird excuse - \\\"the area has a lot of horses so there are a lot of flies\\\"....ookkaay... I asked for to go boxes and she took the plates away.  After sitting there for five minutes, I find out that she discarded all the food instead.  $30 of barely touched food.  I was annoyed but in retrospect who wants to eat food covered in flies?  She was an otherwise sweet girl but next time...there won't be a next time.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "### Input:\nWe had to add an extra night to our vegas vacation due to weather in dallas. We decided to move to the paris from mandaly bay  to try something mid strip. My wife is a big fan of paris so she was very excited. We visited the restaurant the previous day so we thought since that went well the move would work out. The check in process was terrible. The clerk was the absolute rudest person I've dealt with. I could finish a question or sentence without her rudely interrupting. She was short and terrible to my wife and I. She spoke to us like we were half wits and didn't deserve to stay at the paris. I walked away appalled at how we were spoken to at a vacation resort. I let management know I needed to speak to someone asap. The assistant manager called me within the next hour and apoligized graciously. She was very nice and apologetic. She comped a few things and let us check out late for free. Every other encounter with employees at the paris was above average or even amazing. The check in clerk was an abysmal at customer service hence I couldn't give 4 stars. We will come back cause the other 90% of our stay was great.

But, based on Bunny G's review, I looked into this phenomenon and I'm glad to have done so.\\n\\nOK, most of the donuts were/are waayyy too fancy/sugary/decked out for my palate.

So, I'm grateful they had some buttermilks as well as a version of chocolate covered. The buttermilk was sufficiently cakey and sweet, and perfect to share. Yes, to share. So that I can then have some of the chocolate! And the chocolate had a good flavor, and though not traditionally cakey, nor DD/KK airy, it found a nice balance of dough. \\n\\nGet there sooner than later, cause they run out of stuff. Good for them. And, I really liked how they had a Greeter (in a pink hat, no less). A nice first impression after finding parking in the strip mall. (Ironically close to the Gold's Gym - haha).

I almost missed it off 40th street, signage is hardly noticeable unless you are up close to the restaurant. I walked inside and the restaurant is small and casual. Staff is very friendly and I even got to say hello to the owner. I went through the menu and decided on the Texas BBQ burger with sweet potato tots. Order comes out pretty quickly but I notice the portions are pretty small. The burger itself was tasty- I liked that it was different but very messy to eat. The sweet potato tots were also good but the ranch for some reason was very off to me. It wasn't the white, creamy stuff I'm used to, rather almost a yellowish color and very thick.

    "Whole Foods or Copps. Well Copps is just awful and expensive so let's just forget about that. The rest generally have their own issues, like that you just can't get certain things at Trader Joe's and Whole Foods. Basically, I have to go to 3 separate stores within a 2 week-1 month period just to stay stocked in household staples. Woodman's, for the most part, has everything you need. But, and it's a big BUT, you will feel miserable when you are there.\\n\\nNot long after I started going there, I decided I wouldn't go there alone. The clientele is not pleasant to put it mildly.

I just can't, I'm sorry if that makes me judgy. People also tend to wander aimlessly, while talking on their cell phones, and not moving to let you by. There's just a lot of rudeness in general, and no help to be found anywhere. I would rather pay more elsewhere to have a more positive experience that doesn't leave me in a bad mood or feeling sad about humanity. \\n\\nThe store is not laid out in the most reasonable way, and a trip to Woodman's always takes at least twice as long as I think it will. I once said to my husband that I can't go there without spending an hour and a half; although meant as an exaggeration, I don't think I was far off.\\n\\nThe produce is not great, dented, not that fresh. I've considered buying chicken there but it's weirdly expensive. The cheese selection, like the beer, is expansive and cheap. \\n\\nYes, it's employee-owned, but employees don't get mental health benefits.

You can get to and from the airport much more quickly by Taxi, and in the long run it's cheaper.

This place is located in the ASU Tempe campus area but is blessedly *not* a student hang out.  Since Chef Payton came on board recently, the quality of the food has gone from mostly good to consistently very good.  My only qualm (and it's a small one) is the three-dollar shared plate charge.  I find such fees incredibly tacky.\\n\\nThe bar has always been great--excellent selection of wines (including those by the glass), very good happy hour prices.  Between 5pm and 7:30, the smallish bar area fills up with faculty and local business folks, so if you're hoping to grab a seat, come early. Alas, my favorite bartenders Matty and Jamie are no longer working there (the former moved to Postino, the latter out-of-state), but Ian is still on board and the other bartenders *seem* to be good, if not as interesting.  The last time I was there, one of the bartenders had to find another one to make my drink (a very simple champagne cocktail), so I think they still have some training to do.\\n\\nI haven't come for the Saturday INDULJ party brunches, which look incredibly pretentious (as its name would suggest) and cheesy.  The event bills itself as something to get dressed up for, but if you look at the photos on their FB page, you'll notice that the guys in attendance think that wifebeaters, tee shirts, jeans and sunglasses covers that.

    "to the personal touches he adds to the dessert.  I recommend requesting a seat in Action Jackson's station.\\nThe menu is a fusion of traditional English pub grub and American iterations of the same.  Although the shrimp and grits entree are never found on a pub menu in England, the way it was prepared and served creates the illusion that it could be a favorite among patrons of the Duke of Wellington in Southampton.  \\nI disdain grits.  It is a southern thing beyond my comprehension, right up there with fried okra and collard greens.  However, the shrimp and grits at the Red Lion are nothing short of heavenly.  Made with plump juicy shrimp, scrumptious chunks of bacon, mushrooms, lemon-butter, and fresh corn grits, I am confident I could be converted into a regular grit gourmand (provided all grits are made this way).  If you experience nothing more than the service of Action Jackson and the mind-blowing taste of the shrimp and grits, your trip to the Red Lion will have been worthwhile.\\nA favorite amongst traditional English pub regulars are 'bangers and mash'. If you are not familiar with the term, bangers get their name from the sausage's predilection toward bursting or \\\"banging\\\" open during high frying temperatures, and of course, mash is just short for mashed potatoes.  To the uninitiated, this may seem like a very odd combination, but at The Red Lion, your taste buds will dance with delight.  The Irish sausage used in preparing this dish is of the highest quality.  Sourced from a purveyor of fine gourmet foods, they are not available to just any restaurant.  The mashed potatoes are creamy and delicious, and when combined with the bangers, scallions and whiskey gravy, they are elevated to divine.  Although bangers and mash were one of my favorite culinary treats in England, none offered there provided the savory satisfaction as these.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

The oysters themselves were good quality, but they had not been properly clean and my boyfriend and I were disgusted with the whole experience. We asked the manager what was going on since we were used to such high quality there, and instead of bringing us clean oysters or apologizing...he implied that we didn't understand what clean oysters actually were. He explained that because of the quality of these oysters they do not wash them and if we ate oysters more often we would know that. Interestingly, we eat oysters all the time and I'm sure no pretentious oyster connoisseur like the one the manager was describing would appreciate pieces of shell all over their oysters either.  In the end, and after a battle on what constitutes a clean oyster, the manager took some of the oysters off our bill.

I had the tray-tray? which included 2 fried drumsticks and a waffle. I added a side of mac and cheese & eggs scrambled with cheese (I LOVE CHEESE). I made sure to put the Lo-Lo sauce on my chicken (it's their version of hot sauce). Everything was so delicious!! Topped off my meal with a glass of Kool-Aid! I asked the waitress what flavors they had and she replied \\\"red, blue and grape!,\\\" I had to ask if those were the colors or the flavor, then she gave me the flavors...can you say RACHET?!

    "ing.\\nThe Amuse Bouche was a lovely surprise.  Delicious salmon tartare.  I could have nibbled my way through the entire tray of them!  The spiced cashews were nice too.\\n\\nI wasn't crazy about the offerings on the kids menu - they seemed way overpriced ($12 hot dog, $16 tomato basil pasta) and my son wanted Mac and Cheese which wasn't listed.  So I asked if they would accommodate us. Holy cow.\\nThe Chef's Mac N Cheese was so unbelievably good I would go back and request that anytime: For ME!  The chef made cavatappi pasta and an amazing bechamel sauce, with buttercrumb topping - and charged us $12.  SO worth it!!!!  I polished off what my son didn't finish.  I was not ashamed in the least.\\n\\nFor Breakfast:\\nI devoured the NANTUCKET EGGS: Grilled jumbo lump crab cakes, poached eggs, baby spinach and hollandaise sauce.  Scrumptious.  I loved them.  The crab was oh-so very fresh and in nice big pieces.  Hollandaise sauce was on the side so you can control the portion.  My husband felt it was too rich a dish.  But I just loved it. \\n\\nhere's why I didn't give it 5 stars:\\nI did not mind paying the entree prices, but thought the ordinary items were overpriced. \\nAn iced tea was $7.  seriously?  \\nA single scrambled egg (for my son) at $6 \\nEach coffee was $7.  \\nand the big kicker was an 8oz glass of whole milk was $8.00  sheesh.  \\n\\nOverall, I would absolutely recommend this restaurant.  \\nJust be aware that the little ordinary things cost more than one might expect.  \\nHowever, the ambiance, the quality and the service were outstanding!\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "asy and mostly small pieces.  \\n\\nI ordered the Chicken Salad with some type of ginger soy dressing.  It was just ok.  The chicken looked like it had been shrunk...it was pretty dry.  It was basically like what you would get in a frozen fajita meal.  You know how the chicken is small, salty and fatty?  The lettuce was chopped but dry and looked like it came straight out of a bag.  The cucumbers, red peppers and onions that were supposed to be in the salad must have been playing hide n seek.  I think I had one piece of each.\\n\\nOthers are my table tried another steak salad, blackened chicken pasta and the burger.  Everyone pretty much had the same response...\\\"just ok.\\\"  In fact, my friend tried to justify her reasoning for choosing Harper's by saying, \\\"wow, I haven't been here in so long.  I remembered it being so good as a kid so I thought it would be fun to try it again.\\\"  Um, is that your way of apologizing?\\n\\n\\nThe service was decent but our waitress clearly had a bad attitude.  She didn't smile once.  Half of the food for our table came out about 10 minutes before the other half so the manager offered us a free dessert.  I thought that was super classy because we didn't even have to bring it to their attention.  I can't complain about something that was free but I'll let you know we tried the warm cookie that came with vanilla ice cream.\\n\\n\\nI know Harper's is a family favorite for so many so I don't want to burst any bubbles and I can see why people like it.  They have a diverse menu, nice atmosphere for couples or for families, nice location, etc.  They aren't super expensive but I don't think they are priced right for their quality but that's just my opinion.

    "### Input:\nWe were out doing some holiday shopping at the Waterfront and famished, decided to try Gran Agave out. My husband loves Mexican food so he was very excited to try them. \\n\\nWe arrived with our daughter in tow - she is in a stroller. They did not seem terribly happy to have to accommodate a stroller - they place is fairly small but at 2pm on a Sunday it was maybe half full.  We were seated and given menus and a basket of warm chips and what is presumably house made salsa. Both were outstanding.  I ordered a taco salad with beef tips and black beans and my husband ordered 3 beef soft tacos. The portions were huge - neither of us finished our meals. \\n\\nHe really liked his tacos well enough whereas my salad was pretty mediocre. The bottom of the tostada was completely soggy and the beef tips were in some thin, bland liquid that pretty much just felt like water. The whole thing was fairly bland, saved only by the salsa that I scooped over it. \\n\\nWe paid for our meal - very reasonably priced and went on our way... then a few minutes later we both felt absolutely horrible. My husband felt like he had lead in his belly and both of us felt completely nauseous. I turned to him and said I just wanted to vomit to get it out of me. A couple hours later when I am writing this I am still feeling very sick. I we agreed that is was easily the worst meal we'd ever had.

Fish quality seemed to be fine, but the rolls were uninspired at best.\\n\\nThe real problem with this place is that unlike nearly every sushi restaurant I've been to, the sushi chef not only isn't the star of the show, these poor guys have been emasculated to the point they're not even allowed to accept a simple request for sushi. You have to wait for the host who gives it to a clerk who enters it into the cash register and ultimately gives it to the sushi chef who has been standing directly in front of you the entire time. Enjoy the wait.\\n\\nIt absolutely kills the entire sushi \\\"experience\\\" and it seems to kill the sushi chef's enthusiasm too.\\n\\nWith a couple dozen fine sushi restaurants in the area, Blue Wasabi ranks in the top 24 (assuming someone doesn't open a 25th somewhere nearby).\\n\\nThe only reason to go here is if all the others are closed and you're dying for mediocre sushi.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

This airport is really spread out, and there aren't any navigation maps around to tell you the quickest path from one terminal to another. They have the nice little conveyor belts to move you along more quickly if you're in a hurry, but I bet they would be more efficient if 3/4 of them weren't broken down when I was there.\\n\\nThe restaurant selection and stores are so-so at best, and if you find one you like you better eat at it now, because who knows if there is another one in the airport? You'd most likely have to go on a 30 minute hike to find out if there's one closer to your terminal before realizing there isn't and you're forced to eat at someplace else which is more expensive and not as tasty in order to avoid missing your flight.\\n\\nThe good thing about this place though is that everyone I met who worked there was incredibly friendly.

    "### Input:\nI was intrigued by the Malaysian menu after seeing some dishes I grew up on like nasi goreng, mee goreng, beef rendang, and a variation of Indonesian soto ayam that's called Laksa on the menu. The name satay will always be synonymous with my parent's Indonesian heritage of go to dishes that's served along their killer bumbu satay (peanut sauce). So this place had a lot to live up to for me yet I will tread lightly as this is the only Malyasian establishment I know of in Vegas.\\nThe setting is very modern and clean with ample seating. We were greeted & seated promptly by our friendly waitress.\\nWe ordered appetizers to share and definitely wanted to try the roti canai which is a flatbread (similar to naan but greasier) and served with a curry dipping sauce. You must like curry to have this as the flavor is very intense. We enjoyed it but wish it was served with a little bit more of the flatbread to enjoy more than just a small portion of the strong curry sauce.\\nNext was the Korean beef jerky which was ok. The beef had good marinated bbq flavor but was a bit more chewy and not as thinly sliced as I would have liked. It came with a tangy sauce I couldn't quite figure out. The Thai sticky rice was disappointing because we expected a more glutinous sticky rice to come out. The chicken satay was pretty good and well marinated. The peanut sauce did not taste like peanut sauce as the flavor was masked in something else. It was interesting. \\nWe would come back to try some of the main dishes on the menu but my fear is that from my childhood going to another Indonesian family's house for dinner and it not measuring up to my mom's cooking...which I miss dearly.\\nAt least you are doing it Satay Thai Bistro!\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "the past month because it brought me back everytime. \\n\\nI also enjoyed the food options. The buffet (but only for brunch) and the Roxy's Diner (but only the milkshake). There was also a Mcdonalds there that I frequented (hey, good, cheap, reliable, late-night, fast food). The Mcdonalds outside of the Strat and around the corner I also frequented because they had free Wifi (which no Vegas hotel has). There is also a Burger King and IHop near the Strat. I did not appreciate their gym very much because it was small and always packed but I did get to use a treadmill and for paying only about $25 per night, I figured I got a lot more than what I paid for.\\n\\nThe pools are great too. The big pool is rather large with little theming. The hot tub was nice and it was a fun environment. I love the heat of the sun there! The adult pool is also nice with amazing views and nice music. I was not crazy about the tower because it was there I learned about my fear of heights but if not for that fear, that, the thrill rides, the restaurant, and clubs and lounges up there would have been ultimately enjoyable. The clubs and lounges were free for guests always so that made me happy because I at least peak at them (and they were cool) before running to the elevator to make an exit! Entry to the tower was also complimentary because we were guests.\\n\\nThe rooms were definitely functional and pretty with nice red and white tones. It had one of the best room colors I have seen thus far in vegas. The bathroom was not extravagant but simple and nice. \\n\\nI feel that the Strat will fall off even more now that the Sahara will be closing and the AMerican Superstars show left. I mean, what will be the point to go all the way out there except for sleeping there or the thrill rides? I'm afraid I might have to say bye bye to the Strat real soon. *tear*\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

The service however, was not so great and since it's the venue I am talking about I will stick to the experience itself.\\n\\nFirst, I made the \\\"VIP\\\" dinner package reservations and they neglected to put us at our reserved table. Thankfully hubby went looking around and found our names on a reserved table. We waited about 20 minutes before a server even came to take our drink order, which I don't blame the server, it's that the place seats tons of people and there weren't that many servers! \\n\\nWe got there a little over an hour ahead of the show so we could have dinner BEFORE the show started, since you know, it's hard to chew and laugh at the same time, but we wound up not eating until the show started. You do the math on how long that took. The ladies next to us didn't even get their appetizer before their meal and were served everything when the show started as well. The food was ok, but honestly they should just do away with the dinner service due to the fact that service was SLOW, and it's really, really packed seating so when it comes to eating, there is no elbow room or ambiance AT ALL and the poor waitress could barely get to us since we were toward the front of our table.\\n\\nI would go definitely go back to see another show, but I will skip the \\\"VIP\\\" package since there was nothing VIP about it, other than the pricey tab ($150!!!) at the end of the night.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

Luckily, we were able to get last min. reservation at Wolfgang Pizzeria & Cucina.  \\n\\nThis restaurant is easily accessible from both the Aria and Cosmopolitan, which made the walk there quick for everyone in my party.  We were quickly greeted and shown to our table upon arrival.  Once seated a server brought us a wine list which we studied, we weren't sure which bottle of Cabernet we wanted to order, so the waitress gave a suggestion and we were very pleased with her choice.  I really think that they must train their servers well here because our waitress was on-top of everything, and the floating servers made sure our waters were always full.\\n\\nFor appetizer we tried a season sausage... I believe it was rabbit.  Not sure how I felt about eating a bunny but it was ok.  For my entr\\u00e9e, I had the Garganelli Carbonara which was very good.  The Peas were crisp and not over cooked and the amount of Pancetta was balanced with the creamy sauce and noodles.  It was a very delicious and filling dish of pasta.  For dessert I had the Chocolate Gelato Hazelnut Pie, it was ok but I thought that the hazelnut flavor was missing and I wanted it to have a more chocolate and nutty flavor.

In the living area sits a large L shape sofa, a 4 seat dining table & a work area equipped with a fax/copier and plenty of power outlets for your laptop, cell phones & charging needs. The bed was super comfy filled with some comfy pillows. I must agree with another yelper, it's not a standard king or cal king, this king was kinda on the short side. My SO mentioned that his feet was touching the end of the bed. As for my 5'2\\\" frame, it didn't make a difference to me. \\n\\nThe bathroom was perfect for the size of the suite. The throne was enclosed with it's own door, separate glass shower/ tub, his and her sink & a vanity area for the Mrs. I loved the fact that the tub had a nice slant to it, it was super relaxing during my bubble bath. The his/hers sink was major plus considering that there was not a mini fridge in the room, we utilize sink #2 as an ice cooler and stocked it with alcohol. :) Minus 1 star for not having a mini fridge to keep our cold drinks & issues with our key scanner/reader & the long hallway to our room.. It took us several tries to unlock our room. One night we actually were locked out, but the facilities tech response time was very reasonable. \\n\\nOverall, our stayed at the Venetian was great. From the first day at the front desk, to the bellhop, to housekeeping to the facilities tech. The room can easily accomodate 4-6 ppl if you are travelling a group. We would definitely stay here again, It was sweet to retreat to a suite rather than a box. :)\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

I took it in for an exchange or store credit or to buy it back and they wouldn't do it. They don't stand behind their guitars they sell so buyer beware. The staff was not helpful and even though Ive spent lots of money in here before they could care less. I will never shop here again. I will go to an independent store or just buy my guitars online from now on. If you want to feel like you've been completely ripped off and hosed then by all means shop at this store.

    "### Input:\nThey're known for their pancakes, so why would I get anything else? I ordered their Georgia Pecan Pancakes, which I thought would have pecans mixed into the batter. Nope. They're just regular pancakes with chopped pecans on top along with powdered sugar. The pancakes were light and fluffy, except for one of them which was overcooked and hard. Their orange juice is freshly squeezed and mighty tasty. With so many other breakfast places coming up with innovative breakfast items, I'm surprised The Original Pancake House doesn't do the same. Their menu seems more traditional, which is perfectly fine if that's what you're looking for.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "Boo. Can't recycle styrofoam around here.\\n\\nThe veggie egg rolls were good (BOTH of them. :)). The sweet and sour was a bit too runny and vinegary for my tastes. The hubby enjoyed his hot and sour soup quite a bit. I got the wonton soup - chicken & pork wontons. Really nice, light broth. The noodles are nice and thin, unlike the thick, gummy ones that you usually get at fast food Chinese joints. There was not too much filling in the wontons, which was perfect for me since I'm not much of a meat eater.\\n\\nI had the shrimp in lobster sauce - I had asked the girl on the phone if there was any pork in it, since that is traditional of lobster sauce. She said, \\\"Pork?\\\". Yes, pork. In the lobster sauce. \\\"Ummm, I don't believe so\\\". I was skeptical that she knew what she was talking about, but she was right. No pork. Also, no black beans, and no garlic. Not a very traditional dish. Diced carrots, chopped up pea pods and mushrooms with a white sauce with egg mixed in (the only part that was reminiscent of lobster sauce). Tons and tons of shrimp! It was cooked well, the shrimp were perfect, though the sauce was a bit bland for my taste. I added ginger and soy sauce to kick it up a notch.\\n\\nThe hubs got the SIngapore chicken. Another big order with lots of chicken. Good amount of spiciness. Broccoli, carrots, bamboo, mushroom - all were cooked well, nice and crispy. He is undecided if he would recommend it to a friend. \\n\\nSo in summary, some things were pretty darn good, and some were AOK.

I recommend the red velvet or banana pancakes. When it comes to anything else, it's your typical breakfast items. No one can mess up eggs, bacon, or hash right? Service and prices are mediocre. \\n\\nOne major thumbs down is that there was a few ants on the wall next to my table when I've dined in before. \\n\\nThey've recently added a new location & I would tell people to check it out at least once for their pancake craving while in Vegas.

    "they didn't rinse out our cups all the way. Next, my curry was all bamboo. I've had curry (and other dishes) where there were a few strips of bamboo in it, but it's not like it's the main part of the dish. My curry yesterday was just a mound of bamboo with sauce that went halfway up the pile. I found a few pieces of green pepper. I asked for chicken in it and I had like 4-5 small pieces. I had to really look for them underneath all the fluff.\\n\\nThere was just so much bamboo that after eating a few spoonfuls, I had to leave the rest of it. Don't get me wrong, I don't not like it, it's just that it was too much and I thought I got chicken curry, not bamboo with some curry sauce dribbled on top. To top it off, I asked for a 3 (you get to choose the spiciness, 1 through 4 with 4 being the hottest), but it wasn't even remotely hot. It was borderline mild. I remember coming here and starting to sweat over the 3 and 4 (wasn't in the mood for a 4 yesterday), but what I had yesterday felt like nothing.\\n\\nLastly, the bathroom wasn't terrible, but when I walked in, someone used the sink that was out of order, so it was backed up and full of dirty of water, someone had used up all the toilet paper, and whoever that person was, they didn't bother to flush.\\n\\nSo not only did I not really enjoy my meal, I couldn't even go piss out some soap water before we left.\\n\\nI liked this place in the past, but I have reservations about coming back now. I would've given it a 4 before today. Maybe I'll try some other dishes if I ever go back, but I don't think I want to have their curry anymore.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "### Input:\nLike many Las Vegas restaurants whose homes are inside the luxury hotels along the strip, Mesa Grill has an impressive space decked out in top-of-the line furniture and decor complete with a seating lounge area and full bar. Our group of 8 made a reservation here for brunch on a Saturday. We waited around 10 minutes in the lounge before getting seated. The menu for brunch had great variety ranging from your typical breakfast items with eggs, to lunch items like hamburger and dinner-like items like salmon and roasted chicken but of course each choice is riddled with Bobby Flay flair. I'm not a big fan of tex mex, so I opted for the Hamburger. LIke my review, this burger was A-OK. I didn't favor the ciabatta bread and there really wasn't anything too special about the meat or fixings. The fries on the other hand was a nice change. It had a chipotle dusting over it and what impressed me most was the horseradish mustard. I've never had anything quite like it before. Other than the food and decor, our service was top-notch. Out main waiter was very knowledgeable about the food and always there to bring us everything we needed. The busboys were attentive with the drinks/water and clearing out the food. I probably wouldn't go here again just because I was not that impressed with the food but it was more due to my own taste. I'd recommend it for others to try though.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "### Input:\nI had a customer bring there vehicle in for a roaring noise which turned out to be an internal issue with the transmission. We decided to give All Pro a shot at rebuilding this transmission for my customer. The job took them a week with them telling me that they were waiting for parts to come in. I later found out that Jim was lying to me and that Whitey screwed something up and had to take it to another transmission shop to fix the problem. My customer brought the vehicle back several times complaining of a rattle noise coming from the engine. Turned out that the transmission was so screwed up from All Pro Transmissions that it was putting a load on the engine causing it to die. After several attempts to get Jim at All Pro to repair this correctly I had to send it to a real transmission shop for an entire rebuild again. Jim refuses to make good on this job telling me one excuse and lie after another.

A lot of their clothing is inspired many times by other high-fashion designs.\\n\\nThe prices are AMAZINGLY low for QUALITY clothing, and the girls there are extremely ready and willing to help! They will scour the entire sales floor for what you want, and if we don't have it, they will take your name and number down and see if they can find it for you at another outlet in their down time! They even have their own line of clothing exclusively for the outlet, which many times are old pieces that were favorites and have become staples for many!\\n\\nThe sales are amazing! Sometimes dropping even an extra 40% off of your entire purchase ON TOP of the already wonderful prices! (Not sure when you'll be able to find that kind of deal again) Sidewalk sales are some of the best times to get the best items. Oh, and did I mention that you can also use your Black Book membership and coupons too?

They don't take reservations so you have to hope they're not busy.  However, the pan roast here is DIVINE and the chefs and waitstaff (especially Dolores) are a hoot. Every time I am in Vegas, I come here for the mixed seafood pan roast. The seafood is succulent and not overcooked, the sauce is rich, creamy and flavorful. I have had other dishes, such as the linguine and the gumbo, but I still prefer the pan roast. It isn't possible to finish a single serving yourself, so either bring someone to share it with or prepare to have leftovers for lunch and dinner the next day.

We ordered coffee (3.5) and I ordered a Bloody Mary  which was a little on the spicy side but tasted fresh and my husband ordered a mimosa ($6 each). We shared the seasonal fruit plate which has a nice variety of fruit  including strawberries, cantaloupe, honeydew, blueberries, blackberries, and pineapples, but the melon was not ripe and some strawberries were over ripe ($8). I ordered the corned beef benedict ($11) and my husband ordered the classic benedict ($12). The corned beef was a little dry, but I should have expected that! The hollandaise was tart. Best breakfast potatoes I have ever had! We made a reservation per our voucher request but the place was almost empty.

What happened in the next 25 minutes was this: a quick cleansing of my face, some gritty stuff applied and steam in my face for about 15 minutes, a bright light in my face without my eyes covered and a rough rinse off of my face, some really strong (she said it was antiseptic to \\\"kill bacteria\\\") stuff applied to my face, followed by sunscreen ... that was it.

    "sun and waited for them to be done thinking to myself that this whole experience wasn't really that bad! After about ten minutes, the guys called me over and gave me back my keys. I tipped them for a job well done and headed out of the parking lot. About 10 seconds later, I went to turn the radio on and realized that the front of the volume dial was missing! I screeched to a halt, put the car in reverse and went back to the full-service station. \\n\\nI won't bore you with every detail of what happened in the next 45 minutes, but to make a long story short, it turns out that they somehow vacuumed up the little plastic piece. 2 of the guys who had been working on the car gave me attitude about looking for the piece and refused to take some amount of responsibility for the fact that they had damaged part of my car, telling me that they could have the manager (who wasn't supposed to be there until 2 hours later) call me. \\n\\nHowever, I must say that I was very impressed by the way one of the guys didn't follow the others' leads, instead telling me that he would \\\"make it right.\\\" He  insisted on getting the manager there, having her open up the vacuum and digging through God-knows-what to find the piece. \\n\\nAs much as his commitment to customer service impressed me, though, I can't give Snappy more than two stars. After all, if you rewind to the beginning of this review, I told you--my trusty Yelper--that I HATE going to the car wash. I find it time-consuming and painless enough without having to spend an extra 3/4 of an hour at the damn place waiting for someone to fish a piece of my car dial out of the vacuum. \\n\\nLife is too short to waste time at a non-Snappy car wash.

I told the lady that one the phone he told me 8... we went back and forth.. all I remember is walking off because she was getting on my nerves and it was my birthday weekend. Anyway so they bring us the liquor with the girls and blah blah blah, and I really started to drink up. The vibe was WEIRD. I am going to be totally honest and blunt at this point. It was very ghetto, and for sure not what I am used to. I don't do these types of clubs. My friend recommended it to me, but I also have to remember she recommended I go to Pink Rhino and I did and it was as ratchet and ghetto as ever! I didn't know but about 2 songs at this club. I don't listen to hip hop like that outside of commercial or the stuff I may here such as Drake... and 2 chainz. I'm not a true hip hop fan so I can't tell you what's hot all I know is it was tons of black people and hip hop music. I am not prejudice! I am black myself, BUT I prefer a mix crowd, or a crowd where the music is TOP 40... Britney Spears, Rihanna, Katy Perry... Maroon 5, Fun, and just more pop. So yeah didn't like that but I was drunk and ready to have a good time anyway. If you have a table getting to the bathroom is a CHALLENGE and a HALF. You must walk through the crowd... then into a line as they have a few bathrooms and everyone uses it men and women. At the end of the night they charge you an extra 100 bucks for the tip... the girls did nothing... I just had two full bottles... and yeah it just wasn't my style for the amount we paid.

We choose to move because of the \\\"possibility\\\" qualification placed on the offer.\\n\\nThe second room was very nice and the staff was courteous and friendly, especially the bell hop which helped us move.

Maybe that's just me not understanding the squeeze every penny possible out of your guest mentality of resorts in Las Vegas.\\n\\nOur shower and tub appeared to have something weird in the plumbing in that you would adjust the water to the desired temperature and in about 5-7 minutes the cold portion would go to hot and the water would become scalding. There was no cold available to mix with the hot, only hot and hot. After another 3-5 minutes it would go back to normal.  Also had to call and have the toilet in the half bath unplugged, it would not flush. \\n\\nOther than overpriced, dishonest staff at check in, plumbing issues, too short pool hours, it was a beautiful hotel/casino.\\n\\nOh and by the way, the room rate quoted does not include the \\n12% Room tax, Resort Fee, and12% Resort Fee Tax\\n\\nThis added up to another $162.84 on our three day stay, so add roughly $55 to the quoted rate and you will be close to the actual cost.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "### Input:\nI ordered this cool looking drink called the \\\"Ocean Blue Goblet\\\", which is a mix of Hpnotiq, blueberry schnapps, Stoli blueberry Vodka and Bacardi Razz.  Also they put about 5 gummy sharks \\\"swimming\\\" on the top of the drink.  And to make it even cooler it has dry ice in it to to give it this wow factor.  So not only did it look cool but it was delicious.  My boyfriend  ordered the Sugar Factory signature burger.  Oh my goodness this was so good, I wish I would have ordered it too but I snuck in two bites before he wolfed it down.  It is a burger that is cooked to perfection and the differences of this burger compared to most other burgers are that it has munster cheese, crispy fried onions, their own spread, and the best part a white chocolate bun.  Which gave it just a hint of sweetness that was not overpowering but enhanced the burger.  In an attempt to be on the healthier side I order the Chinese chicken salad which was everything you would expect a Chinese chicken salad to taste like.  It was definitely a great choice.  Just I wanted that burger!  After we finished we went to the candy store part of the Sugar Factory (they are right next to each other) and had my sugar fix and got an assortment of gummy candy and sour belts.

The food was just okay. The sliders were supposed to have some sort of sauce/aoili on it, but did not, just the cheese. A small container of ketchup was on the side; I had to ask for more.

Instead of anything new, or even a cool atmosphere, it was just a hot empty room in the front and a half packed room in the back. We got there before midnight and got in for free with our local ID. \\n\\nIt is bad when one of the employees prefaces your entrance with, \\\"Don't be surprised that the room is empty, there are more people in the back\\\". Okay... I guess I should be going somewhere else. In fact, I was at a gay bar near university and left for this club. The only difference was the previous place was jamming. \\n\\nOf course, the booze is expensive. Of course, it is slightly uncomfortable. It is not as dressy as people has been reporting. It was an awkward mix shorts and flip flops, bow ties and button downs, khakis and polos, and various other states of dress. \\n\\nBesides being with friends, I can't say I enjoyed the experience there.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

If you're having problems sleeping at night make sure to check this place out for dinner! ;) Your taste buds will enjoy the food and your brain will enjoy its \\\"powers\\\" to put you to sleep (like a food coma). But really- the dishes were delectable. \\n\\nThis is in the NE corner if 101-N and Broadway. With the outside sign a bit tattered, this little market still boasts a dining experience to talk about. Staff immediately greeted and asked whether it was dining in or ordering to go and chose to dine in. To the right there were several tables and booths to choose from. Immediately was given menus and asked if ready to order. Waitress was attentive. Chicken shawarma sandwich was around $4 and the kabob combo (kabobs of chicken, beef, and lamb) with rice, salad, hummus and warm pita was about $12. When asking the waitress what kinds if meat was in the combo she said she doesn't know- and just works there. That was odd because I would have thought that if she wasn't knowledgable about what was on the plate that she could have at least asked the other staff. A skilled worker should at least be knowledgable about those basic popular dishes. Maybe in time. Minus that part everything was exceptional. Baklava was super sweet and delicious. Ended up buying a few more baklava to go!\\nOnce you're done just check out with the pleasant cashier at the front, and off to get some powerful coffee or to that comfy bed awaiting. ;)\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "cucumber for crunch, and a shiso pesto on top.  All that with a little avocado to bring it together.  Very light flavors, but well balanced.\\n\\nThe poke roll was awesome, but it seemed more like a play on poke.  It did have some chunks of tuna on top and I'm not complaining about the fact.  It also had some macadamia nuts and avocado, which is relevant.  The cherry tomatoes were a great addition as well.  But, I didn't see any green onion, nor did I even taste a hint of seasame oil or soy sauce.  Then the big ole' tempura shrimp threw me way off.  The flavor of poke that I am used to just wasn't there.  All that said, it really was one of the best things I had and honestly, it would be easy to overpower the dish with sesame oil, so no harm done.\\n\\nWe ordered other things as well, the green papaya and mango salad.  I like mine a little more made for gringo's.  I thought the fish sauce was overpowering and I really didn't get much mango flavor either.  We tried the QC roll too.  Good, but in no way the highlight of the evening.  All in all though it was a pretty good meal.\\n\\nOn a downside I will mention that our waiter wasn't the most pleasant and personable person I've ever met.  I wouldn't be happy working with a place that is pretty much empty this close to the holidays either though.  The demeanor was nothing close to what some people have said in some of the bad reviews though.  I did go without water for a little while, but he was pretty attentive in general.\\n\\nBottom line is, I liked the food and I'll be back.

I have no idea what the resort fee is for because nothing I saw during my stay resembled a resort in any sort of way. They took an hour and a half to get us checked in. It was 11 at night and there were four of us. They had three people \\\"working\\\" the desk. There was no reason it should have taken so long. Most of our time was spent standing there staring at each other. I stayed in the courtyard rooms and it smelled like something died in there. I didn't look under the bed for fear that I might discover I was right! The carpets were so filthy I didn't want to walk around without shoes on. The water was shut off so for the first hours of being there I couldn't use the sink, shower, or toilet! The beds have only sheets in them. No comforters and they were covered in little black dots. I got bit by something multiple times while I was asleep then when I got home I discovered I had picked up bed bugs from that dump so I had to spend the rest of the weekend battling a bed bug infestation. If it were possible to give -stars I would. This place is a hell hole and I won't set foot in a palace anything ever again! Oh and they feel the need to charge me an extra $25 after I left for who knows what because I didn't use their internet (it won't let you even if you try) or anything else while I was there. \\n\\nOh and just as a warning, the courtyard rooms have no elevator so if you are on the second floor you are going to have to carry (i.e. drag) your luggage up two flights of stairs.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "here\\\" and a whole Delmar \\\"to go\\\" for her hubby. I ordered a whole Turkado for \\\"here\\\" and a cup of soup \\\"to go\\\". Simple.\\n\\nFirst she brought to the table 1 half a Turkado. We both looked at our receipts confused and confirmed we both ordered whole sandwiches. We let the girl know and she brought out another half. Confused still we told her we're both still missing a half a sandwich and while waiting starting eating our halves. We both agreed that they tasted extremely bland and was made very sloppy. She than brings another half a Turkado and assures us this equals up to 2 whole sandwiches. No.\\n\\nShe comes back but now with 2 whole sandwiches and tells us that they belong to us until another coworker comes snatching them from the table saying they don't belong to us. Than comes the Delmar which was not wrapped up to go along with another whole Turkado which we switch with one of our untouched halves. This suggestion made her hesitant to actually give us exactly what we ordered. No people we're not attempting to fool you. We just wanted what we paid for. Now that we had our sandwiches I tell them I also ordered a cup of soup to go. Frustrated she tells me she brought it out a while ago and I told her that I didn't want it. What?? When did this happen and why would I turn away a cup of soup I paid for? Finally she brought that stupid cup of soup, dropped a spoon into it and walked away. Really? I walked up to the counter and asked for a lid for my soup and to have the Delmar wrapped to go.\\n\\nThrough this whole experience I said thank you when the sandwich came, when my soup arrived, and even when they handed me the lid at the very end. At no point was there ever an apology. They actually treated it as if it was our fault all these problems were occurring.

    "Very unprofessional...we had a scheduled appointment at 8am and she arrived just after 11am. I gave clear instructions on how I wanted my two golden retrievers to be TRIMMED short but NOT SHAVED. It took almost 4 hours for her and her assistant to complete the job and instead of trimming like I instructed she had SHAVED my dogs!! Later that day I realized that she had shaved my male dog (Jake) so close to the skin that she cut him in 5 areas on his body and left razor burn throughout the rest. If you look through her pictures you can see the pictures I uploaded  to show you the damage she has caused and give you an idea of the pain Jake is dealing with. Please do your animal a favor and look elsewhere for a groomer. \\n\\nWhen I confronted her over the phone and through text the next day, she claimed that her assistant must have done that to him. I demanded a full refund and she said she would not give me any of my money back. After hours of arguing with her, she then claimed that she had before and after photos of Jake that proved that he did not leave her van looking like that, implying that I must have shaved him more after she left!! I never wanted my dogs shaved in the first place.. why on Earth would I shave him even more and inflict pain on him?! Two hours later, she finally sends me a picture of some random dog's backside that she claims is Jake's. First of all, the color of the dog's coat is not even the same color as Jake's, the coat is still fluffy and not shaved at all, and there is tile in the background of the picture.. I am 95% sure there wasn't any tile in her van.

    "### Input:\nThe good part about Il Mulino Italian restaurant is its wonderful location and charming atmosphere! Food is ok, really nothing special! Why? Because it's greasy, oily, heavy handed on sauces and either bland or not sophisticated enough which is not a good place to be considering all the great choices out there when it comes to Italian dining. When seated, the complementary parmiggiano, salami and a few other antipasti is a nice gesture but it's a bit old world and unnecessary if all you expect is exceptional service and cuisine which this place clearly can't provide. Some staff members are better then others especially the ones that are not italian! The ones that are Italian are way to proud of themselves and their attitude is a bit strange and unprofessional! Why? Because    our waiter for some reason had the audacity to grab the payed bill and check it right in front of us as we were still finishing our meal! Pretty embarrassing moment for this restaurant! By the way, I am an American citizen and was born and raised in Italy so for me to criticize the Italian staff isn't easy but I will this time because their attitude and manners is just pathetic. The favorable reviews posted are the reason I wanted to try Il Mulino and now that I have I am a little weary and unsure as to where these reviews are coming from!

She was told that they never expire by a staff member and then was put on hold while the staff member got the manager on the phone. The manager said that the number on the gift cards would show if they were valid or not and if she brought them in the store he would look them up. She then told him that she had the gift cards and could give him the numbers over the phone. He then said that he did not have time to look the gift card numbers up. My friend, frustrated and astonished that a manager would treat her so horribly called back and asked for the corporate or district manager's phone number, which the manager Mike refused to provide.

    "TBA (Turkey, bacon, avocado) on amazingly awesome sour dough bread. I just want to buy a entire loaf of this bread and take it home and just....well....frankly.....eat the hell out of it. \\nGreat Coleslaw! Awesome selection of unique meatloaf's & turkey burgers. Great fresh veggies.\\nI enjoy eating here and not feeling fat and like I just ate a pound of grease. Everything is so full of flavor and just straight up a good healthy option for breakfast/lunch/dinner.\\n\\nGreat service!!!! They seem to always have plenty of servers and people behind the counter every time. \\n\\nDecent sized parking lot and Atwood parking also. \\n\\nA real fun lunch/morning atmosphere with great d\\u00e9cor. \\n\\nNow as for the cupcakes. I've had so much better. I've tried at least 6 different kinds now just to make sure I was not missing something. At this point in the game I think I have a fair opinion about them.\\nIf you looking for a cupcake mixed with a muffin this may be what your looking for. They are all a little Grainy. I just can't find that mix of light and fluffy that I'm looking for.\\n If I'm eating a cupcake, I want to be thinking dessert the entire time. The frosting is just not good either. Stiff and not so creamy.\\nThe last one I had was called a \\\"polar icecap\\\" I believe, and it tasted like minty chalk medicine flavoring yuck--yuck---yuck. \\nOut of all of them so far my favorite was a peanut butter flavored one....It was ok, but again....more like a muffin with frosting on it than anything. \\nI think it may be best for me to just differ from these cupcakes for awhile and stick to what is amazing at Daisy.....the food options!!!!

It seems that Indian restaurants have either an over the top design with big floral drapes and bronze whatnots, or they'll be a bit on the trashy side. 80's, diner style tables and Bollywood TVs. Chutney's was right in the middle. Comfortable, inviting.\\n\\nI love that they mark what is and isn't vegan which is something a lot of Indian restaurants don't do which can make ordering a pain in the butt. Especially if the servers don't have very good english.\\n\\nI had the veg vindaloo which was very good. A bit more watery than the vindaloo I'm used to, but it's forgivable. I really like a thick gravy in all my curries, which this didn't really have. The spice level was perfect. Lots of crisp cauliflower and toothsome potatoes & chickpeas. This would easily be a 4 star if not for 2 things:\\n\\na.) Despite the dinning area being near abandoned, service was slow. I was in for perhaps 15 minutes before I got my drink order in. There's really no excuse for that.\\nb.) They didn't bring me rice with my vindaloo. We ordered 3 curries and only two plates of rice came out.\\n\\nSo, there you have it.

My climax with sushi was 3-4 years ago, now I get bored with it. I'm more of a NEW American/French food lover. \\n  First off, the server wasn't very informative, so I talked to another server passing by, she actually gave me some good guidance. We ordered a wide range of items, going off their recommendations. We started with sashimi yellowtail with jalape\\u00f1os. Of course it was good, Yuzu makes anything rock, and fresh raw fish does it's job well, no help needed. Second was the lobster ceviche. I found it boring, uninspired, bland. Sorry.   Third was the new style sashimi, salmon. This was by far the best. Slightly cooked, warm sesame, miso sauce. Delish.  Main courses were the black cod miso,a restaurant favorite, but not my favorite. I just kinda ate it, without having any real feelings for it. I was just thinking ok, maybe the next plate will be better. Creamy spicy rock shrimp tempura, I had two pieces and decided it was time to order a freakin sushi roll and call it quits. I'm hungry and not so impressed. Thank god I wasn't paying.  I ordered the nobu roll I believe, it had ahi tuna, yellowtail, avocado, scallion, masago.  I didn't think I'd have to get a roll to be happy and satisfied, oh well..\\n\\n\\n\\n My only recommendation,  the new style sashimi.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

Meanwhile, Derrick and the girl who checked me in continued to help other customers who walked in after me with what I assume were quicker purchases (I was trying to buy a phone, others seemed to be buying items unrelated to their accounts). I told Derrick that my biggest frustration was not the wait, but that no one told me when I walked in how long the wait would be, that there were 5 people on the floor when I walked in in addition to the 2 of them and now there were only 2 (3 others had mysteriously disappeared behind that depressing staff only door in the back, and that they still didn't know how long it would be.\\n\\n25 minutes later, I got to see someone. Because of something that the Sahara store had done, my account shows that I'm not eligible for an upgrade, though I am. I visited the sahara store a couple of weeks ago and they said the saw what the problem was and had made notes to my account that I am eligible. Neither Derrick nor his salesperson were able to find what the problem was on my account nor the notes that were (according to Sahara) made to the account.\\n\\nClearly, there are some managerial problems with this store. As I was leaving in frustration and trying to understand why I had spent so long in the store only to find out that they couldn't help me, Derrick told me that he thought he had \\\"been more than understanding\\\" about how long I had waited and the situation with the upgrade. That was the end of the line for me. I had been understanding by waiting so long, by not raising my voice, by not storming out. The person who is paid to help me and sell me things was not being understanding by doing his job. \\n\\nGo here if you want to wait and want frustration.

    "safe in our room broke at check out.

Be sure to ask.\\n\\nNote: The restaurants in the hotel were really good (went to Bouchon twice, and a mexican place in the Canal Shoppes that had a pretty good happy hour), and the cabana was probably the most enjoyable part of our trip. The cabanas at the Venetian pool are directly next to overly-crowded, tiny-pool-ed Tao beach, and are significantly cheaper, yet you can still hear the DJ, and everyone is having a great time. Chase was our host and he was the only person at the Venetian who was fun and acted like he appreciated our business.\\n\\nOverall: if/ when I go back to Vegas, I would either stay in a cheaper/ more gimmicky hotel OR stay in one of the other supposedly big boys, but one where I know they will appreciate my business when I bring in 10 people who are all staying, eating, gambling, and clubbing all weekend.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

I gotta admit, she was cool... she was patient and was willing to go ask the kitchen if the chicken salad had any onions in it... and it didn't btw - (yay!). So props for her on that. She even kept my mom's chickery spiced coffee aflowing and even got us some splenda for our drinks. I also  have to mention that nothing on that menu is over $10! Score!  \\n\\nOur food came and we were starved! I tore into my chicken salad and it was goooood... creamy, slightly sweet, nutty and chicken-y. I was in love. I wish it came with two pieces of toast instead of one, but I guess it's okay. The fruit salad was good, but I wish it were more seasonal... the maranated salad was okay too... a little too sweet for my taste. The potatos I had screamed onion powder! I tried to power through it but the taste was too strong. I couldn't finish it. My mom loved her spinach and tomato omlette and can't wait to try it again. \\n\\nOver all, we had a good time in the multi colored dining room in the middle of downtown...

Only 18 dollars for brunch without drinks.  22 with unlimited alcohol--cheaper than bellagio without unlimited alcohol!

They had Vietnamese beef pho they made right in front of you and it wasn't bad (I'm viet and had my share of good/bad pho).  It made me feel all warm and fuzzy.  They also made wonton soup!  At the same spot, they had different kinds of dimsum.  Shrimp balls (awesome) and shumai (not so awesome).  Next to the noodle bar was chicken congee (asian rice soup).  I thought they executed the Asian food quite well!  \\n\\nOn to the other areas.  The seafood spot was okay.  The crab legs were extremely salty for some reason :(   so I didn't eat many of them.  The dessert spot was WEAK.  There wasn't much compared to the Bellagio buffet which has a bajillion pastries.  It was like I was staring at a meager dessert spread at a chinese buffet.  The italian spot only had pizza and the sushi area was okay.  \\n\\nI believe the key to having a good buffet is people standing there making delicious foods as you walk by like a sushi guru handing you a freshly made spicy tuny roll or a baker stuffing cannolis.

A small is available as most Americans I bring here are unable to finish a bowl.\\n\\nSpring rolls are great (cold/fresh) with a peanut dipping sauce.

    "### Input:\nCafe Roma is decent.  No better no worse, it's just decent.  The restaurant itself is very dark inside, which makes it hard to read the chalk-written menu hanging 10 feet up in the air.  They offer a decent selection of standard pizzeria fare including pizza, pastas, and subs.  I've never had their pizza strangely enough, but every time I see people eating it, it looks tasty.  I've had their subs here before and I find them extremely lacking.  Surprisingly enough, I get more meat on my sandwich next door at subway than I do here.  The bread is also really crusty.  Sometimes I like that, sometimes not, but be warned, it can break your teeth if you aren't careful.  The first time I came here, I ordered pasta, but they said they were out of it and I found this really weird, especially since it was like 5 pm.  I figured they just had vats of sauces and tubs of pasta in the back and they slopped it all together when you ordered it.  Oh well.  Another time I came back and tried the pasta again, this time they had it.  It was pretty decent and their marinara sauce isn't bad.   Use a plastic fork if you are going to eat pasta here because there is something really wrong with their forks.  I swear the metal rubs off when you eat because you get a wicked metallic flavor when using their forks.  Overall, a pretty decent place if you are looking for a quick dinner before heading over to a movie at the AMC.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "### Input:\nMy boyfriend and I decided to give this place a shot because it was close to an appointment I had to go to in 45 min.  It gets one star because the fish wasn't bad, but we barely got enough to say we were eating sushi. We did AYCE for lunch on a Saturday, not many people there. \\n\\nWe are nigiri kind of people and rarely ever order a roll.  Everything we ordered was all rice and a sliver of fish.  The rice needed work too.  When we asked for tobiko he said he only gets it once a year. Lol. OK I'll just keep going to the other places who have it all the time. \\n\\nIn hopes that we could find something positive to say we ordered some things from the kitchen. The shrimp tempura was warm not hot and the batter tasted as if it came from a box.  The agedashi tofu was anything but.  It was just two fried pieces of tofu sitting on a small puddle of ponzu...not even the right sauce guys. Tonkatsu was thin pieces of pork and really tough. It looked as skimpy as the fish. So I'm sorry to say nothing was good.  \\n\\nThis place is a rip off. Will never return or recommend.  Better to take your business to consistent places like goyemon and sushi mon.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

The owners are very nice and try to accommodate you if you have a special request. The food is very 'New York' style with spicy brown sauces that were salty as well.

    "showed up about 20 minutes before our reservation.  We checked in with the girls at the desk who informed us that they'd get started setting up our table.  They then seated us early which was really impressive as the place was packed!\\n\\nEverything about David Burke was top notch.  The service was excellent, the decor, the presentation of our meals.  Oh and the food was excellent.  \\n\\nWe each started off with different appetizers.  I had the gazpacho that was served with avocado and crab.  It was perfect.  My dining companions had the tuna tartare (presented beautifully and got rave reviews), the crab cake (also rave reviews) and the oysters.\\n\\nFor dinner, I had the grilled tuna which was lovely.  It was seared but rare and flavored just right.  My dining companions had the chicken, the steak, and the fish of the day which I believe was Dover Sole.  All again gave rave reviews and plates were cleaned.\\n\\nThen dessert.  I had the banana split which was one of the best.  Homemade ostrich egg ice cream (if you've never had ostrich egg ice cream, I highly recommend it.  It's even more creamy than regular ice cream), fudge sauce and candied pecans over a warmed, baked banana.  Absolute highlight of my meal.  The rest of my dining companions opted for the creme brulee.  They were five separate flavors each served in a shot glass.  All were eaten completey and I sure didn't hear any complaints!\\n\\nOf course, this isn't the kind of place you come every day.  It's expensive for sure.  But I felt that the quality of the food was on par and the service was fantastic.

    "### Input:\nThe husband and I were very hesitant in checking in after the reviews on  here. We purchased a Groupon they had for a very cheap price. We stayed here for the weekend after Thanksgiving and we even called another hotel on the way to Vegas in case this place was exactly how we read it was. The check-in was smooth the gentlemen in the front was polite. The lobby was clean. We liked that we were able to park next to the building we stayed in so that was a plus. The area is not so great but we were mainly concerned about getting our car broken into which we didn't. I did end up killing a small little spider by the door (inside) the hotel. We stayed on the second floor which was ok. This place is by an airport so you will hear planes either getting ready to land or taking off. I heard it all throughout the night good thing I'm not a very light sleeper but when I would wake up I can hear them all the time. Our stay was ok only one pool was opened not too bad since it was in late November and it was a bit chilly. Overall if your on a very low low budget stay here I guess.

I'm not a dumb traveller, i follow the rules and have everything opened and placed quickly so that I can go through security as fast as possible. They still, however, insist that I go through the full body scanner (\\\"the violator\\\"), and have even criticized my clothing choice (the zippers on the ankles of my skinny jeans should not cause alarm, seriously). \\n\\nThe way that the terminals are separated, with specific restaurants in different areas, makes it so you have to walk forever through a maze of people, employees etc. It's just ridiculous.

    "### Input:\nIf you are looking for good quality teas without any flavor or with one flavor only (i.e. ear grey or rooibos peach or green tea mango etc.) - this is not the right place. It's way too overpriced, does not carry many good teas, and too sales oriented (they will try to make you buy a tin with your tea purchase). You'd be much better buying the teas from adagio.com (the teas are sent to you in tins, they cost at most 50% of teavana's prices, and are of much better quality). \\nHowever, if you like to try blends of many flavors (i.e. samurai chai mate or apricot caramel torte or azteca fire), Teavana may be a good place for you. All these blends use inferior quality tea, but they are so overpowered by other flavors that it does not really show. They are still very pricey. Some of very similar blends may be found on specialteas.com, also at 50-80% of what teavana sells them at. The after dark melange tea from that website is one of my all time favorites. \\nAll in all, I would recommend trying Teavana for unusual blends, but not for high quality basic teas. I think that have to make up for their expensive locations by charging much higher mark ups than their competitors. If you don't want to waste money, don't buy on the spur of the moment. Do your homework by checking adagio.com and specialteas.com before you make a purchase.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

Exposed brick, exposed HVAC pipes, servers in concert t-shirts, and stripper poles make me one confused girl on what the heck Digestif is going for and I am sure it wasn't because I had a few glasses of wine at Kaz beforehand.  Plus I understand it's a restaurant, but places with a single stall bathroom for each sex irk me.\\n\\nThe food I tried was all completely underwhelming. I had the Sicilian caesar salad which was basically just watery lettuce. Although it looked like there was dressing on it, I couldn't taste any. Plus a good amount of the lettuce was brown. Needless to say I didn't eat the whole thing.  The chevre I ordered was delicious as it is really hard to screw up cheese, but I wish they gave you more than two little pieces of bread.  I tried Ashley A's pasta which was extremely salty, and I also tried Kristin S.'s scallops which were incrediby overcooked.  I shouldn't have to chew for like two minutes to eat scallops...they should just melt in your mouth.  My sauvignon blanc was just OK, nothing spectacular or worth raving over.\\n\\nService was very spotty and by the time we were done eating, I was completely over Digestif. When the server asked about dessert, I practically screamed (just so he could hear me because it was very very loud in the restaurant), \\\"No we'll just take the check!\\\".  For the 8 of us, our bill was around $240 which did not include gratituity, which confused us. Most restaurants will automatically add tip for a group of our size but our server did not.

The management team running this place probably have more restaurant experience than you anyway. Jackie was our server and she was pretty good for the most part. We didn't wait too long for our food because I think she had rushed the kitchen since we had asked how much longer it would be before our food was served. We order the chicken sisig, pancit canton and a whole chicken. Shoulda just ordered the chicken like everyone said. Although I did enjoy the pancit canton because they used a different type of noodle. On the other hand, the sisig was just a mess, what's up with the mayo?! It didn't have the vinegar in it like the traditional way. I read in another review it is like flop of mayo called sisig, which is true so I don't recommend ordering this. We had to wait a good 20 minutes to pay because supposedly the credit card machine was acting up, but Jackie was very apologetic about this.

I've had plenty of Thai before and this place is fairly average by comparison, which basically means that it's worth return visits. I've been here a few times and it's pretty consistent - a large seating room, never had to wait more than a few minutes for a table (usually we're seated immediately on arrival), the food's ready pretty quickly and if you order spicy you get spicy. One of the highlights of the restaurant is the male waiter. He bows, scrapes and simpers in a way that almost makes me chuckle whenever I go, almost like a Saturday Night Live parody of a waiter.

    "us.  Was there a logical reason?  No.  We would have liked to do so, but c'est la vie.\\n\\nWe ended up doing regular restaurant/kitchen dining, partially as a grave miscommunication between us and the server.\\n\\nWe ordered their \\\"Grand Ichi Ban\\\" sushi plate and yakisoba to share between two adults and a child.  This included a variety of side dishes, as well as California rolls and an assortment of nigiri.\\n\\nThe appetizers (miso soup and cucumber/bean sprout salad) were delicious and well timed, although I really could have done without the mushrooms in the miso soup.  \\n\\nTheir yakisoba included a rather bland \\\"teriyaki\\\" sauce that I felt relied too heavily on salt, as well as having the inclusion of mushrooms (which I have never seen in yakisoba ANYWHERE else, and personally is disgusting to me).  The California rolls were unremarkable, and it seemed as if the avocado wasn't exactly \\\"freshed sliced\\\", even though equivalent rolls in the pacific northwest ARE, even when avocado is out of season (surprising given Arizona's proximity to the crop).  While most of the nigiri was tasty and of quality presentation, the baffling choice of Imitation Krab for one roll (and an oddly cut, overly long, blocky piece at that) was very baffling.\\n\\nNot having a lot of experience with sushi in the desert southwest, I'm not quite sure wha the standards are, but by my standards, it falls short... and for far too much money for the product.\\n\\nAlso, the waiter took far too long at the end to present the check.  I had to actually request it in a fit of desperation as my preschooler had lost his attention span and was causing a disruption.  Apparently that in and of itself was not enough of a clue to the waitstaff that they were taking too long...\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "### Input:\nUsed to go to this Joe's location somewhat regularly back in 2005-2008 until we relocated. Long story short, we moved back home in August. Once we got back and settled, we made a point to return to our old hangout. Needless to say, while the outside remained the same, much else has changed. Inside is completely different and menu wise it is substantially different. Mainly,  prices have hiked to a level where Joe's has become a \\\"once in a blue moon\\\" visit instead of a regularly visited establishment like it used to be. The service was very good however, although I wish out server would have had exact prices of the menu items. We were told the shark bite drink for two was $9; once we got it and began drinking it, we were informed it actually was $15. $6 may seem like no big deal, but it certainly would have made a difference on whether we chose to buy it or not. When we have drank out of it, we can't exactly say \\\"oops, no thanks.\\\"\\n\\nOther than this, Joe's is a nice little establishment. The manager Scott seems to genuinely care about you having a good experience, the food was good as always, everyone was extremely nice and my kids enjoyed themselves.

    "### Input:\nJust sent this message to Channel 13 Action News Reporter.\\n\\nHello Ms. Darcy Spears.  Sorry to bother you via social media.  I would like to know how to go about submitting a story concerning my experience at Centennial Toyota in Las Vegas.  I brought my 2008 Toyota Sienna in because the door did not open when I pulled on it.  This is a $50K vehicle as it is fully loaded.  I had to make a deposit to have the car looked at.  Three days later I was told my car door was fixed.  Toyota showed me where they charged my warranty $2200 dollars for the door repair.  I tested the door knob and found that the door was the exact same.  Toyota gave me an appointment to have the door rectified, but they tried to charge me the deposit again to have it looked at and threatened to charge me to have the door handle fixed even though they got $2200 from my warranty company to supposedly fix the problem that I brought the care in for.  When I asked what they fixed for the $2200 they got from the warranty company I learned that it was unrelated to what I brought the car in for and I did not authorize random work.  I went in for the door handle and the door handle alone.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "delivered. I gave them my home address, paid with my credit card, and got a crappy handwritten receipt, plus an e-receipt via Square. \\n\\nAfter a couple of weeks went by I never received either a package, nor a message from the store stating that the package was shipped, with a tracking number provided. I called the store and got a guy who was very nice and apologetic and took my information, said he would look into it, and would call me back immediately with a status update. \\n\\nA couple of weeks pass again, and I've heard nothing. I don't have time to track down things I've already paid for and figure out why they haven't been shipped to me yet, so I wrote it off as a lost cause. But I figured I'd give them another chance. I called again and spoke to a lady who said she was the new store manager and that they had been busy planning a new store opening, and she was just gaining an understanding of what had been done there, etc. I didn't need to hear her story, but she sounded sincere, apologetic, and seemed like someone who had their stuff together. Finally, I thought, I'll be able to get this really cool gift that my wife would LOVE and that I have paid for delivered to me. The lady found my information on file, apologized for it \\\"slipping through the cracks\\\" and would contact me back by close of business with a tracking number.\\n\\nSo guess what happened next? If you guessed nothing ... DING DING DING, you're today's big winner. I waited about 5 days, heard nothing, and filed a dispute for a refund through my credit card company. \\n\\nAgain, let me stress that the merchandise they sell here is fantastic - some really cool stuff. If you live in the Las Vegas area and can buy and take the merchandise home that day - and afford it - you will be happy.

Like the other people have said, the meat loaf is the thing to order here. One bite of this and you'll be transported to fluffy meat loaf smothered gravy heaven! (does it exist? YES!) Thing to stay away from were the ribs. I think there were only 3-4 ribs and they were covered in so much sauce it made it difficult to eat. The smothered chicken was quite good also with large pieces of chicken and lots of savory gravy. So why did I give this place 3 stars? Mainly because the portion size did not match the price. This is geared towards the ribs and the meat loaf. Even though they do come with sides, the main reason why I ordered the entree was to get the entree.... and not the sides.... so I expect a larger portion.

The string beans remained crisp in the sauce, which saved the dish.\\n\\nFried Chicken Wings - Fantastic!  Not too greasy, prepared with chili oil, diced jalapenos, scallions, and garlic.  This was the best thing we ordered.  It was more salty than spicy.\\n\\nSweet n' Sour Chicken - High quality white meat chicken made these little fried morsels pretty enjoyable.  The sauce was a bit bland, so I just dipped in Sriraucha sauce (Thai chili sauce w/ the rooster on the bottle) which helped a lot.\\n\\nVeggie fried rice - Bland, with chunks of vegetables that would have been better cut smaller.  Not worth ordering really.\\n\\nOverall this place is nothing special, but for a delivery Chinese meal it is pretty good, and worth the 40 minutes you may wait.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

I'm so glad he did. He pointed out some good things about the wallet that I was looking at, and making some suggestions about hardware and other things to consider. In the end, I purchased a beautiful rose gold wallet with gold hardware. It will go perfectly with my Hamilton bag that he also made some great comments about. Gina is awesome too.

Paint's chipping, carpet's buckling, etc \\n- the staff are ok, not a lot of big genuine smiles (although the waiter on my last morning was very sweet compared to the women that worked the rest of the week) \\n- the internet cut out A LOT which is annoying when you're trying to work \\n- no wine glasses in the kitchen (they had a corkscrew though). Not a big deal but... \\n- no recycling program!!! NOTHING.

The bouncers aren't dicks here like they were at other places. I realize I'm a girl and so generally bouncers are nicer to women but thats not always the case. Great music inside, good crowd (didn't get the pretentious feel I did from Pure) drinks were strong and the bartenders were nice. The floor was bumpin and the pyrotechnics just electrifies the place.

Sounds amazing right? It was decent but it's a fancy name for stew atop large thin ravioli. Im not disappointed in my dish but far from \\\"wowed\\\". For dessert Tres Leches bread pudding.. can't go wrong right? For all bread pudding lovers.. its usually super moist and doughy.. and if youve ever had Tres Leches cake also supermoist. The combo..NOT supermoist? Some parts were, but most was dry like panetone. It was topped with ice cream and that should have been a clue. Bread Pudding should never need ice cream as a sidekick, it should be able to hold it's own. This dessert was beyond disappointing.\\n\\nI expected so much more from this place.

I know what your thinking, how could anyone complain when it's free AND complain about a spa!\\n\\nWhen we first arrived we were checked in by a friendly staff member and we told her it was our first time visiting.  She walked us to the stairs and said the service staff will then take care of our lockers, etc downstairs. The service staff retrieved our spa shoes and locker keys and left us guessing after that.  I said it's our first time here - where do we go?  He pointed us to the Men/Women rooms where he said the lockers were and that the massage therapist would pick us up in there.\\n\\nThis is where I got upset. No tour, had no idea where anything was, pretzels on the floor, kleenex dispenser empty, no toiliet paper in the stall, stall door lock was broke, candles weren't lit etc.  As I sat in the lounge to wait for my massage, I overheard a staff member giving a \\\"tour\\\" to another lady.  Wow - where did I go wrong after telling them 3 times that we had never been there! (once over the phone).\\n\\nThe massage was great as was the therapist Jennifer.  After the massage Jennifer told us about the couples Jacuzzi.  We got dressed and went to the Jacuzzi, tried to turn it on - no bubbles!  I asked a therapist if I was turning it on incorrectly and she stated that the bubbles weren't working but you can still sit in it.  What?  I can sit in my hot bath tub at home if that was the case!\\n\\nNeedless to say, we left after I couldn't charge my cocktail I ordered to my spa account at their private pool.

    "many bad experiences here, there just isnt room to describe anything but the highlights. The last straw came when late last year I decided to take a spa day to relax and work some of the kinks out. SO I schedule a extra long deep tissue and get assigned to a therapist Ive never seen before. She takes me back and is some God awful irritating French woman who starts the massage and make me feel horrible the entire session and gives me the impression she's making a pass at me. Did I mention she's like 50 and f-ugly as hell. By the end she had applied so much pressure to my neck (in medically inappropriate ways) that I left in extreme pain. To top it all off, the whirlpool was offline that day, the steam room was broke, and as usual, the staff are a bunch of rude idiots who could care less if you need help. I had enough of their poorly run business and filed a complaint with management. I also threatened to sue them for malpractice. The Marketing Vice President contacts me and promises to fix everything. Im told I will get a gift card to reuse whenever I want to replace the bad session. I accept the offer and return about 4 months later. Guess what, the bastard gave me a blank gift card which makes me have to pay for the follow up appointment since I cant cancel at the desk. Then I get back to the spa and yet again the damn whirlpool and steam room are off line. \\\"Some guy cut himself on the tile and bled all in the pool.\\\" the attendant tells me. So your pool is sharp enough to cut people and now is full of infectious blood. Thanks. So I go back to the massage, and guess what. I had specifically asked for a therapist I had never seen before to avoid any of the prior problems. Out comes the short little French troll. But with a different name tag. Did you guys know they switch the name tags of the therapists to keep you guessing? I walked out. Hell Ive even had a therapist high on pot here before.

THAT is how we felt for close to two hours as we wandered the various exhibits.  \\n\\nWas that necessary?  I don't think so.  I was told no less than four times that I wasn't allowed to take pictures of certain pieces because \\\"they didn't have the rights to it\\\" when there were no signs explaining so.

The servers and the sushi chefs were very nice and accommodating. Because we were at the bar, there was very little wait time for our sushi and the waiter was prompt with our other side orders too. For an ALYCE sushi place, the quality was awesome.

For the specialty rolls the dragon, sexy girl, and maguma. The extra stuff from the menu we tried were the ahi poki, fried calamari, yakitori, and mochi ice cream. Their regular tuna nigiri was the only let down as two of the four pieces we had didn't taste as fresh as the rest of the sushi we had that night.

    "as it was the last time.  And I again wish I had just ordered 4 of these for my entree.  I would compare this to sweet, salty baconny goodness.  \\n4.  Kobe Sashimi - everyone on the table loved this we did two orders.  Call me a purist, but I really would have liked less...flavor.  Like the big eye, there were just too many flavors going on around such a great central ingredient.  The sauce muted the beefy goodness.  On the plus side, this was butter tender and really tasty.  \\n\\nWe each had different cuts of meat, and everyone was happy with what they had.  If I remember correctly, my friends ordered a filet, New York Strip and Illinois Rib Eye.  I had the Nebraska Rib Eye.  All steaks were ordered medium rare and all were perfectly cooked.  My buddy who had the Illinois (bone in) Rib Eye and I swapped pieces and we both agreed the Nebraska was far and away superior in flavor and tenderness.  \\n\\nFor sides, we only had the creamed spinach and pureed potatoes.  The egg on the spinach could have been cut up better because the pieces were pretty huge (picking nits on that one, eh).  The potatoes were really nothing special and were seriously lacking in flavor; maybe they just need to add some bacon to that thing.\\n\\nI did order a bottle of Kaesler Avignon Syrah, which went waaaaay to fast.  It felt like our server just wanted to empty the bottle out as quickly as possible.  Maybe I'm just a pretentious wine snob, but I like to let the wine in my glass open up before pouring more.  Is that too much to ask?

I personally love the Ding Dong Burger... it simply gives an amazing asian flair to an already good burger.  \\nAlso, if you are a corn-dog lover, then this is the place for you.  These aren't your standard, buy them frozen and in bulk, and we can can stick them in the deep fryer and hope they taste good, corn dogs.  These are GREAT corn dogs, with flavor in every bite, and blanketed in a great cornbread covering.  Yum!\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "### Input:\nI finally got around to trying Bar-B-Q King.  The weather was pretty nice so it was a good day for a drive in.  I always try to keep an open mind when eating at a place for the first time which can be tough after reading reviews about the place.  I ordered BBQ plate which comes with 2 sides.  I got fries and slaw.  My visit was on a Saturday between noon and 1 pm.  The place seemed pretty busy with about 50% of the stalls occupied.  It took a little while to get my food, but not so long as to start thinking, \\\"where is my food.\\\"  The server dropped my tray off and quickly moved on the the next car without getting my money.  Odd, but probably the most efficient.  The pork was minced with sauce on it.  The slaw was also minced rather than being shredded.  There was also a sandwich bun along with the fries.  I was able to get some pork without sauce to try first.  The pork was moist and tender, but very bland.  I then tried some of the pork with the sauce and the sauce was bland too.  There was no smoke flavor at all.  The fries were good, fluffy on the inside, but not quite crisp enough.  The slaw was crunchy and fresh, but it too was bland.  I don't really care about the sauce.  Tastes vary and some like it spicier than others.  But the pork although being tender and moist was disappointing.  Overall it wasn't a bad meal, but it wasn't good either.  Again there are better places to go for much better BBQ.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer. How many evidences are listed in the review?\n\n### Response:3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ",

I guess so, because it worked! \\n\\nOverall, meh. The lobster roll was very good, but everythiing else we had was pretty average. The sunset and dark circle rolls sounded very promising and delicious, but they were surprisingly flavorless and boring. \\n\\nI liked that it's a totally unpretentious and cozy joint, but I definitely think that there is better sushi to be had out there.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

I could relax here all day!\\nAnyway...\\nWe tried this place out on a Sunday afternoon, they have 1/2 off drinks all day. During the week they have 1/2 off sushi and drinks but I did not mind paying regular price for how good it was! We ordered 3 rolls: Shrimp Bizkit - SO delish! My new favorite :) We also ordered the Marilyn Monroll (raw, huge sushi rolls!) and the Kaboom (california roll with, quite literally, a huge pile of shrimp and krab on top! Bring your appetite for this one.)\\nOur bartender was great, she was extremely friendly and fun to talk with.

    "### Input:\nI was wandering through Montreal trying to kill time (and also got a bit hungry as it was around lunchtime), so finding some generally positive reviews on Yelp, I decided to try Nu-Do.\\n\\nAs people before me have said, the big draw to this place was that they have hand-pulled noodles.  I really liked how their noodles were made to order; the noodle guy came out from around back to make the noodles as I finished ordering.  This guy was by no means an expert noodle-puller (an expert would've been much faster), but they were cooked just right (not too mushy and not undercooked), and the beef was also very well cooked.  The soup has gotten many compliments here, but it seemed pretty standard to me - however, I did like that it is less salty than most other places, so you can really pick out other flavours in the broth.\\n\\nPortion size-wise, I thought it was a perfect size: just enough to make you feel satisfied without being overly full.\\n\\nAs others have also touched on, the only drawback was the wait.  I went on a Friday afternoon (about 1:30pm, so after the lunch rush), and still had to wait a bit before I could eat - on the one hand, it's understandable because it's made to order, but it's also in a food court, so you would expect a bit more expediency in the food prep.  After I had ordered, and before I got my food, there was a sizeable crowd of people also waiting...I can't imagine how they deal with an actual lunchtime crowd!\\n\\nPrice-wise, I paid a bit over $10 for a bowl of beef noodle soup.\\n\\nOverall though, it's a good place to eat if you want something tasty, not super-filling, and have a bit of time to spare.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "### Input:\nOk...so we went back and tried it with my mom who has eaten at the chi location. We went to see the show and my mother insisted we try it. We tried some items and this was a new menu, but a shocker the staff still didn't know what was in the items nor had they had a chance to try them from what our server had told us. The young lady at the end of the kitchen was wiping her nose on her arm, disgusting. And as we walked by my mom liked the lay out due to the chef being in arms reach to speak too, I guess the chef is on the line in chicago, but he didn't want to be bothered. \\n\\nThe servers were a bit more attentive this time around, so some improvement.  Hosts were on point with greeting, and the patio seems cool. No table visits by a manager or chef, and it was still slow for mid week. But again it is the Monte carlo, and in the middle of a reconstruction. \\n\\nAs for the food it was better all around but still not comparable to raku and fukumimi.  And again the hygiene standard of the cooks, I know they are union but that is a manager issue to enforce. \\n\\nSadly if it wasn't for my mother I wouldn't have been back and again no reason too...best of luck hate to see an empty restaurant,  but there is more to this restaurant being empty then just construction going on around new York new York and monte carlo.

    "Input:\nReally gorgeous rooms, great bathrooms...even if we did find a (new!) condom hidden under the telephone. I guess some poor guy didn't get as lucky as he hoped. I agree with most of the reviews that the maid service is generally on the piss-poor side--very inconsistent cleaning times, almost never taking away old dishes in the hall, unfriendly attitude, etc.\\n\\nThe customer service is really the problem here. This place is obviously just too massive for anyone to really give a damn. We had to call downstairs for extra sheets for the sofa, and had to call back twice because it took close to 2 hours. We called to get a fridge (they charge) and that took hours, too.\\n\\nWorst of all, like SO MANY reviewers on her, my friend accidentally left her $400 Stuart Weitzman boots in the room...gone, gone, gone. (She had even left a huge tip for the cleaning crew, so oh well.) Based on the other reviews here, I seriously doubt they even HAVE a lost and found. The number of reviews where valuables are **actively stolen while people are simply out of the room**, however, is a huge red flag. I think there is a safe in the closet, but that's hardly comforting.\\n\\nThe shopping is great here, the faux-Venice canals are fun, the casino is pretty great (I'm not a huge casino person but I thought it was fun)--but yes, the drink service is ABYSMALLY slow in the casino. Sort of pointless really. The pool is also nice, but due to where it is placed, it never received any sun and I honestly don't think it does any time of year. Kind of baffling. The 2 spas are pretty nice, it was just a shame when they were overridden by fratty punks.\\n\\nVegas has a near-daunting amount of choices, why settle for a place that has these kinds of problems when there are so many BETTER places?\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "of a $150 food credit.  With so many quality restaurants in Las Vegas, the ones at The Tropicana aren't on the top of my list.  They're not even on the list.\\n\\nBut color me surprised when I saw their 4 course tasting menu with wine pairings for only $39.  Hey!  That made \\\"restaurant week\\\" look expensive.  It's a shame we didn't even get to the third course after 2+ hours.  I felt even worse for the couple from Italy at the next table playing the same waiting game.  Why in God's name would actual Italians eat here?!?!  \\n\\nTheir saving grace was that the food I did try was actually decent.  The \\\"Risotto Capesante\\\" with scallops, asparagus and prosciutto paired with a crispy white wine was surprisingly good.  I would've been happy with this dish as all four courses.  The \\\"White Peach\\\" salad I received over an hour later was also good but the wait made it taste a little less good.  My dinner companions ordered a la carte and got the veal parmigiana (huge and juicy) and shrimp risotto 90 minutes after ordering.  If they actually got this whole \\\"serving food in a timely manner\\\" down, Bacio wouldn't be a half bad place.  \\n\\nWhat the heck was going on in the kitchen??  My guess was the chef suffered from narcolepsy.  We had less than 35 minutes to make a 10pm show at Caesars Palace.  I spoke with the manager to express my displeasure and he took the 2 course dinners off the bill.  The server was super nice, apologetic and took care of a round of drinks too.  At least they made an effort to make it right.  They then boxed up our last two courses of lobster gnocchi (rubbery) and apple granola cheesecake.  The dessert then melted in my car and went straight into the garbage.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

This place got mentioned a couple of times, and I'm nearby daily so I decided to check it out. Honestly, I was expecting to be disappointed but... This is not ramen at all. The broth is extremely thin and tasteless, the vegetables were precut and the meat precut and precooked, so dry. I found the noodles a bit soggy and the seasoning was just... Pho-like, honestly. I'm disappointed, I really wanted to get my ramen fix, but this is not the place. :( if you've had ramen in Japan, I doubt you will like it here.

    "### Input:\nI chose to go here solely based on the way the food was described on the hotel pamphlet and Yelp reviews. It probably would have been a worthy meal  if it had just been the cost of the unlimited wristband ($25) plus $15 but this was solely for breakfast ALONE. Dinner prices were the unlimited wristbands ($25) and an additional $25. FLIP WHAT? That's right we paid $50/person to eat here. I was contemplating going somewhere else but after an almost hour wait and reservations at Insert Coins, I already had to push back once, I said forget it. Now if you're not going to eat seafood or high end meat, save your money and go somewhere else.\\nI ate 3.5 plates of crab legs, ceviche shooters, shrimp cocktails, mussels and oysters. The other half a plate was pickings from here and there. The one random pick that that I ended up really loving was spicy fish. The fish tasted like it had been marinated in a in seasoning that had a quick but low kick of heat and a splash of salt at the end. I was sad I didn't find it until my last plate but something tells me it wasn't the best thing for you. \\nI was so full I didn't really get to try much of the dessert. I had a creme brulee which was fabulous. It was caramelized to perfection on top while being thick and rich in the center. I also grabbed a couple of cookies for the road which were nice to snack on late in the evening after drinking. I would save this buffet for special occasions. I don't know if would ever come back to eat just for the heck of it.  The wait alone had me ticked off and starving.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "seated by the back of restaurant and Jason was server.  Nice boy!  Literally! Husband ordered the stuffed tilapia, sorry, out of it at 4:30 PM! substituted sole. I had the Lobster tail, shrimp scampi, fried shrimps (tiny) and crab legs.   Meal arrived, crab legs smelled at the connection where the legs are of iodine.  Bad sign, old!  Lobster tail overcooked.   Husband's dish were 3 or 4 pieces of fish, no stuffing, no lobster!  Took back lobster tail, took back husbands fish.  Returned with new lobster tail.  Couldn't get any meat out of crab legs, Jason put on plastic gloves and took out about a tablespoon of crab out of three legs. Cold!   Husband still not getting his meal.  When it was finally served, I was just about finished.   2 small pieces of fish wrapped around stuffing, 2 pieces of lobster! no broccoli, just a baked potato.   Never got more biscuits either.    Gave the server my $50 gift card and a credit card as bill was almost $40 told him to take out $25 from gift card and put rest on credit card.   Got back credit card with $23 charged to it.  Where is the gift card?  Oh, he said \\\"I threw it in the garbage!  Unbelievable!!!  He dug it out and gave it back to me and re-did the entire bill.   Now it was $25 plus the balance on the credit card. WOW!  I went to the bar manager, because I had asked for a manager before getting the bill and she never showed up.   The bar manager took the receipts went back to check that I had $25 left on my gift card.   Instead, he came back and gave me a NEW card.    Wrote to Red Lobster corporate and called up today.

    "n\\n*  The P.A. System was blabbing out rap music!\\n\\n*  The Mongolian BBQ didn't have the sauces out where you can put them on yourself, & it's not really set up so that you can talk to the chef to tell him how you want it prepared.  I loaded up my plate & turned it in, having topped it only with a little garlic that were accessible there, to see what would happen.  What happened was that it came back to me very bland.  Not 'bad', but certainly not great like at Chinese Gourmet Buffet, Crazy Buffet, #1 Eastern, etc.  Mongolian BBQ is all about the sauces!\\n\\n*  The mashed potatoes were soup!  They looked like Cream of Wheat when you first start to cook it!  Whoever put that out obviously didn't have any idea what mashed potatoes are!\\n\\nOk, there's your 1-Star stuff.  The story doesn't end there, though! \\n\\n*  After a few minutes, the music changed to soft Chinese instrumental music, just fine for the place!  Apparently, the preps had the rap on before opening time.\\n\\n*  When you skip the potato soup, that still leaves you with 101 other trays of food, not counting sauces & dressings, & every bite of it I had room to try was at least ok.  The fried chicken was very crispy outside, juicy & tender inside.  There were two kinds of bone-in ribs, & both were good.

Great mixture of seating and tables and a proper turntable and old fashioned vinyl playing in the background. They even encourage you to bring along your own vinyl to play while you're in too, which is a cool idea.\\n\\nAll looked and seemed promising enough but the food was not good.

I noticed that sometimes the food isn't very consistent.  \\n\\nThe one thing that might surprise you is that their salad bar is AMAZING.  I get a huge salad with everything on it.

    "patio a few months back. We arrived on time, we seated promptly at a nice table and brought water immediately. However. It went down hill from there fast. Two different servers came up and introduced themselves as our servers. It felt rushed. We gave one our drink order, only to have the other come up and ask what we would like to drink. What...? The wine came a long while later. We put in an order for a jidori chicken appetizer with a server and some guac made table side. Both were good. For dinner we ordered the diver scallops and another chicken item. Right after one server took our order for entrees, another came up and dropped off dessert menus. What...? Did we not get our entree order in? We will never be sure when the entree orders were put in. Did the server forget? Why did we get dessert menus? It took almost an hour for entrees to come out. Which was fine as the appetizers filled us up. But still. Both entrees were good but I've had comparable food with proper service at other places. My scallops were perfect although I realized I wasn't a big fan of the set it was with. Boyfriend liked his chicken. We were planning to get dessert but after all was said and done I was full and completely turned off by the service. Our bill was somewhere around $130 before tip. I've worked fine dining, I'm still a server. This was the worst service I've ever had, not because the people weren't nice but because it was so chaotic and stressful and the energy was reflected onto the guests. Def not worth $160, which is a lot to us. Lastly, I forgot my sweater there and didn't realize until we got home. I called the restaurant and the host said they had it. I gave them my name and number and said I would be in the following day. I went to pick it up the next morning and it was no where to be found. Kind of ridiculous if you ask me. Save your money. There are so many other wonderful restaurants in Old Town with service that isn't so stressful.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "). The onion soup I did not care for(although I LOVE onions), nor did the people at the two tables beside me apparently.....The salad I had, the garbage salad, however was quite a delicious mix of flavors. The ribeye steak itself was delicious , very flavor packed. It is probably one of the better steaks I've had compared to the numerous pricey steaks I've had at other fine dining restaurants. For dessert we had mini tiramisu, strawberry cheesecake, and pecan pie tasters. Those were delicious as well.\\n\\nNow as to why I deducted two stars. When we first arrived, our waiter said dessert would be profiteroles for the night. Great, I love profiteroles....but that's not what we ended up with!....what a bummer. Second, when we received our appetizer soup and salads we were supposed to have Cesar salads, as he set down our plates he even said 'Cesar salad'! But instead we had what I now know as the garbage salad. Clearly cesar salad does not have salami, shrimp, artichokes, shallots, olives, and blue cheese in it. Third, when our rib-eyes came out they were accompanied with a mushroom with a stem of rosemary poked through...he said it was a horseradish stem!......I myself cook regularly and knew that was not a horseradish stem. I was quite appalled at how he tried to pass off his lack of knowledge and attention to detail on us. I sat there in confusion as we received each part of our meal and each time I had to check with my husband that I heard what I heard. Our server honestly didn't look like he cared for his job as he was too distracted by the preseason NFL games on TV near the back of the restaurant and he sure didn't check on us during our meal or ask if we were enjoying our food. \\n\\nNonetheless, the food was spectacular but the service was quite poor due to our waiter.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    ". The other day I stop by before I went to work. I walked into an empty restaurant, which worked out perfectly because I was in a bit of a hurry. I spent about 3 mintues looking at the menu as the women behind the counter was in conversation with another customer who had already ordered. \\n\\nOnce I walked up to the counter to present my order I realize that the women behind the counter was also on the phone, which I assumed she was on hold or something because she wasn't talking and asked if I was ready to order. I said 'yes' and told her my order, but half way through placing my order she put her finger up asking me to hold as she grabbed a pen and pad as she began writing stuff down. I back away to respect her privacy as I thought it was either a personal or business call. \\n\\nAfter about 5 minutes she then hung up the phone and ask for my order a second time. As I told her my order I then asked her if they cook their food with any type of fish or peanuts since I am highly allergic. She said that they cook with no peanuts but they do cook salmon. She proceed to tell me that the salmon is cooked on the grill and my order that I place will have to go on that same grill. I asked if there is a way you can clean off the grill or cook it a different way and she said 'No we can't, that is just they way it's cooked'. \\n\\nIn a way I was a bit shocked, one, the fact that they are willing to lose a customer so quickly and two, it seemed like there was absolutely no other way around cooking my order differently.\\n\\nI responded with a long drawn out 'Okay'. The women behind the counter then responded by saying she didn't want to have liability of me getting sick. Which in a way I see where she is coming from, but then again I am a paying customer.\\n\\nIn conclusion I have heard good things about this place and people I know rave about their bowls, I may have had just a bad experience, but I know I will not come back to this place again.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

At any rate, he was not eating, just baby sitting.\\n\\nThe menu is sparse with only 6 featured items and then a few other items like a vegetarian sandwich and a soup of the day.  I wish I had taken the soup of the day (Creamed Green Chili) but unfortunately, I had the 1/2 lb hamburger called The Cabernet Burger because it's flavored with a Cabernet wine.  I'm sure that a lot of people would like this burger but it just wasn't for me.  I'm not sure if there was too much wine in the burger or if the meat was just too greasy because the bottom half of the bun was soaked with something - either grease or wine oozing from the hamburger meat.  In all honesty, I did eat 1/2 of this huge monster of a burger and 1/2 of the fries - that would be the half that weren't overly deep fried and hard as wood.\\n\\nMy wife had the Quiche Lorraine that comes with a salad and was supposed to have balsamic vinaigrette but to me, it looked like they forgot to add the dressing or if it was supposed to be on the side and they forgot to bring the dressing with the meal.  My wife passed on eating the quiche because it was a little runny for her taste.  Quiche has to be baked for about a half an hour and then it has to set for a little while before being cut and served. It is my guess that this quiche was baked much earlier in the day and then left out under a heat lamp.  It looked like the egg / custard mix was starting to 'melt' and as it did, the crust began to get soggy.  \\n\\nSo, we paid about $22 bucks for half a burger a dry salad and a glass of tea.

Our servers were on top of everything but not intrusive & the manager, Rene, was friendly  & knowledgeable about all aspects of the restaurant.  For our appetizers, we had oysters on the 1/2 shell, wilted spinach salad & heirloom tomato soup.  All we're yummy.  We've come to realize that splitting a steak between 3 people is the way to go.  In the past, half our steak would go to waste as these steaks are huge!  We split a bone in ribeye and there was still a couple of pieces left over. The reason you get so full is because the sides at Delmonico are out of this world! This time around we had the potatoes au gratin, creamed spinach & creamed corn.  I could make a meal on Delmonico side dishes alone - they're that good!  While they've served up delicious desserts in the past (what? No more bread pudding?), we just didn't have room for dessert this time.  I can't wait until we are back in Vegas again & have the time to stop by this gem of a restaurant.

    "### Input:\nI frequent this F&E because I work in this neighborhood and it's sadly one of the only grocery stores within a 3 mile radius. Literally. It's your typical F&E, pretty well stocked and lots of great lunch selections-hot and cold. They recently discontinued one of my F&E staples, a spicy mac and cheese that hit the spot on days when work was giving me reason to drink and I had to substitute with food. \\n\\nThe employees are ok, helpful for the most part but the patrons are the type of people who shouldn't be using the self-checkout system. That's all I'll say about that. \\n\\nThey always have discounted wine (I should know) and a decent selection overall. My favorite thing at F&E is their store brand roasted banana gelato. I have a theory that everything can be made better when you roast it and bananas are no exception. Take creamy gelato and mix in a slight hint of banana with a lot of caramelized goodness and you'll have to work really hard not to take out the whole container in one sitting. \\n\\nMy other F&E staples include the Italian deli salad, southwest Caesar chicken salad and the buffalo chicken wrap. None of them are extraordinarily good, but do the trick when you need a quick fix for lunch.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "### Input:\nI love the idea of a pizza place where you can customize your own personal size pizza and have it ready in just a few minutes. Unfortunately, I found it much more appealing in theory than in practice. Going down the assembly line was very chaotic; since they place was so crowded they were really trying to hustle. The counter for the toppings was kind of a mess and I found it a little unappetizing to watch the plastic gloved hands dipping in and out of all of the bins. There was a lot of cross contamination going on. The meats were also not very appealing since they were mostly ground up into a crumble (presumably so it would heat up faster). I did enjoy the capricola ham but my hubby was pretty disappointed in the unidentifiable meat they referred to as \\\"steak\\\". The dining area was equally crowded and messy. There isn't really any organization to the way they have set up the tables and chairs... they are just kind of thrown together in the middle of the room and it is very difficult to maneuver between them. We opted to sit outside but I am sure the booths would be comfy on a day with less people there (not many of those so they were all taken).\\n\\nThe pizza was actually pretty tasty but not good enough that I would go out of my way for it. But if I needed a fast food lunch then I'd choose this over a burger place any day. I would not come again for dinner though... it is definitely not a sit down dinner type of place. I may give them another shot after the new restaurant buzz dies down.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

My dogs really enjoyed the obstacles that they had to climb on and so did a lot of the other dogs by the looks of it. :) I wish there was more grass though. I could see that it probably would get pretty muddy in the summer time with all the water and what-not. but in my opinion that is to be expected.

It was actually to the point of being kind of divey (and not in a good way--I like a good dive bar or a tacky truck stop as much as the next girl--but this was just plain dingy).  I ordered the open faced turkey sandwich.  The turkey was cheap prepackage deli variety--blech.  The bread was slightly toasted wonder bread (seriously?).  It was bland, soggy, and nearly inedible.  It came served with garlic mashed potatoes which, I'll admit, were pretty good (but by no means redemptive).  My dining companion ordered the French dip, which was also prepackaged processed lunch meat type of roast beef.  He reported that the fries his sammy came with were 'pretty good.'  So, I guess they're semi-competent in their potato preparation. \\n\\nTo top off the grimy atmosphere and foul food was the weird service.  It was wacky at best (drug induced at worst?).  Our waitress was a complete space cadet--forgetting things from one moment to the next, running around like a chicken with its head cut off--and we were the only ones in the joint (what she was so crazed about, I have no idea). \\n\\nOverall?

    "### Input:\nI was disappointed by my visit to Bach Burger for the first time. We took out of town guests here telling them how great it is. We waited 45 minutes for a table. I m so confused what happened to the Spicy Miso burger. I have had it a couple of times at the Summerlin location and loved it! This time the burger was smothered in a red sauce that tasted very similar to the sauce on the Kalbi burger. My friend got the Kalbi burger and although I love spicy, kimchi, and kalbi, that burger just did not have a good flavor. The sauce was something like a Sriracha sauce but overpowered the entire burger. \\n\\nAlso, I have tried the Truffle fries here and don't like the taste. The salt and pepper fries have a strong pepper taste and among 4 people we did not even finish 1/3 of the fries. The sweet potato fries are the best among the fries choices but the dipping sauce it comes with is gross. Way too sweet and strong of a taste, not complimenting it at all. \\n\\nI don't know if it was an off night or the chefs are just not as good or ingredients used were different. I really don't know why the experience was so different from the Summerlin one.

There is more than enough variety to make everyone happy.  The sushi and dessert selection is so so, and it gets a star off for that.  But the green tea ice cream can usually save the day.

    "### Input:\nThe last time I was at Freakin Frog was probably 6 years ago. I had been going there quite often for about 2-3 years. What I loved about it was the wine and the atmosphere. Oh and the fried olives. But what a selection of wine! Adam, the owner, is a connoisseur of just about anything wine, beer or whiskey. We; my friend and I and Adam, would sit and talk about a lot of things for hours. So yesterday I decided to stop by. There were a couple of people at the bar and only one other female besides me. It was so dark I had to wait a while before my eyes adjusted. Well it's changed a bit. The only wine available is Sutter Home in the small travel bottles. For $6 a pop, hence the 4 stars, really guys..... HOWEVER, Jason, the bartender, is the kind of employee everyone should have working for them. He saw my face when he said Sutter Home, not that it's bad, it's just not my particular taste. After a couple of minutes he asked how my wine was, I asked about the owner and mentioned the bar was bigger than I remember and blah blah. He went about his duties and a couple of minutes later he comes back with two bottles of wine that were chilled and unopened and asked me if I wanted a glass. Jason gets 5 stars for being resourceful, thoughtful and a damn good salesman. I respectfully declined, BUT..... that is how business is done. I know about the 1000 beers and 900 whiskeys but I remember the wine. I will go back because of that. Just wanted to let everyone know my thoughts about it....... ; )\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

The food was good, exactly what you would expect for the prices. \\nHowever, the service was shameful! Half of our group ordered salads and they all came out together perfectly and were delicious. For the main course,  4 of us ordered steaks and the other 2 ordered a seafood platter. All of our steaks were brought out at the same time but the seafood platters were not included or mentioned. After about 5 minutes I was able to flag down a busboy and inform him that we were missing 2 dinners. It took him a few minutes to hunt down our waiter and a few more minutes to bring out the food. Now our steaks have been sitting on the table for over 10 minutes while we waited for everyone to be served. And to top it off the waiter hides from us for the rest of the night and never apologizes. But you can be sure that our bill included the 20% gratuity for parties of 6 or more.\\nI guess since our tip was locked in the service was not important.\\n\\nI also want to mention the hostess Lily and busboy Rupert were very helpful and should  be commended, they were the only ones who cared enough to apologize.\\n\\nTo top it all off we were charged a $50 corkage fee.

We were then taken to our table , and squeezed into our seats; felt like a sardine.  The server then came , really nice lady ; and brought over some small silver trays that look like a cat milk bowl ,serious. At first i thought the silver trays were for appetizers, but happen to be the bowl where i was going to make my dish from. The lady then toke us over to the food barr area , the food  barr area was so comfined. It was difficuilt to pick and choose my items because of the glass. When it came to choose my sauces it was so hard to pick and choose since i was given a small cupp. The sauces were like corn syrup and sugary . When it came down to making my bowl i asked for brown  rice and ended up getting no noodles in my bowl. The server then brought me cooked noodles on the side, no flavor what so ever . I was upset and told the serverv that i wasn't happy with my meal she then asked if she could bring me a lettuce wrapped ,  i told her sure. Wasnt excited about the lettuce wrapped .The manager then came and apoligzed and said he would take it off he check.

After the inspection of coarse they came back with some things my vehicle needed. To be expected, that's what they do. I am not a mechanic but i know the basics.The recommendations were legit. Although I passed on all and just had the brakes done cause that's all the budget would allow. I have been happy both times and those times were on two different vehicles about 5 years apart. Fair price,good service. going back in a few weeks to get the rear brakes done next. Thanks guys.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "ale\\\" burger joints, and tons upon tons of fast food places, one could easily forget about Fatburger. And if they did, I wouldn't blame them. So far, my experiences at this burger franchise could be summed up by the following word \\\"Meh\\\"\\n\\nI've been to a Fatburger in Vegas, and in many other cities as well. Nothing that I have consumed at any location has warranted another visit. Like mentioned before, with a dearth of burger places here, as the saying goes.. Beggars can be extremely choosey. ;)\\n\\nBut when that green-eyed monster commonly known as Groupon reared its head towards me offering me 50% off on food at this location, I had to oblige.\\n\\nSo with 16 bucks worth of Groupon money, I had to find a way to get the most out of this single visit. And they had that option for me.\\n\\nXXXL burger - a 1.5 pound burger of massive proportions. At 12$, I opted to add toppings rather than go with the combo, so I added bacon, guacamole, and a fried egg. Every time I have ordered a burger at Fatburger, one thing has always resonated with me, it is dry. They grill it to order from a raw patty, and it's dry, every single time. The guac was pretty tasteless as well. The egg is cooked hard, which is pointless because the only reason to put an egg on a burger is to see the runny yolk ooze onto the patty. The only thing I liked was the bacon.\\n\\nWith a price point similar to smashburger, I'd rather go to smash. But I would save some dolla's even further and stick to the in-n-out. The only good thing about this place is that it's open 24/7. But if all the other places are closed and you really needed a burger at that hour... I guess it would be alright (but only in those circumstances)\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer. How many evidences are listed in the review?\n\n### Response:2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1",
    "with the water - high dive (60 feet!), the synchronized swimmers, the incredible opening only can be done with a theater of this magnitude.  \\n\\nAnd the performers?  There's something about seeing a show where most of the cast is original.  Yes, a lot of these performers have grown with the show - they arrived in their early teens and even some of them have children of their own.  They own their roles and delight in doing them - the performers are a family and treat the act as their own creation and put their heart and soul into every bit of it.  And they constantly work to improve the act, make it more difficult, add more tricks - depending on what night you come you may see solo or duo trapeze or crazier versions of acts - one act of the Washington Trapeze has the girl balance on her head on a swing, go into a single handstand while spinning and then set herself down to start all over again.  One of the versions of highdive starts with a handstand or one diver holding up the other in an angel pose before they fall into the water together.  It's really something.\\n\\nIf you're looking for something to get your blood pumping, this isn't the show for you.  I have friends who have \\\"fallen asleep.\\\"  I've had friends who cried.  The surreal imagery of the silhouettes of the carrousel horses at the end brought a lump to my thoat.  \\n\\nAnd a random note - to those who like to fan the flames of the \\\"Le Reve vs O\\\" argument - Dragone created BOTH shows.  A lot of costumes and elements in one are in another.  Same product, different flavor.  O is supportive to Le Reve and vice versa - to the point where both shows used to play soccer games against each other and train with each other.  Both shows have a element that strongly differs from each other, and that okay.  O is the elegant, older sister, Le Reve is the crazy red-head sister.  Both have their own style and appeal.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "nThe place is very clean & modern, well organized. Staff & range officers were all very friendly & knowledgeable.\\n\\nThankfully, safety seems to be enforced heavily throughout the place:\\n- If a 1st time visitor, you're required to watch an 8-minute safety video & then sign a form (After this initial safety video briefing, I think you're exempt from viewing it again for about a year)\\n- They make sure you're wearing eye & ear protection (which they provide) before entering the range - & they always remind you to put these on each time you enter the range\\n- A range officer was always patrolling to make sure everyone was shooting safely\\n\\nYou can either bring your own or rent their firearms (each piece is priced by the hour & ranges from $15/hr to $65/hr, a few are $125/hr). I think you have to pay a range fee of $15, too, but not sure as my boyfriend paid for everything. Not sure if you are allowed to bring your own ammo, but they have a big selection of ammo at their store for you to buy.\\n\\nThey provide you with free targets by the main counter. You have to go through 2-3 different doors to enter the (indoor) range. Range has like 30 shooting lanes with electronically-movable targets.\\n\\n1 other cool thing: If you rent a handgun for an hour, you can switch it up for a shotgun with no additional charge 1/2-way through, which is what my boyfriend & I did. We rented a Glock 30 for 1/2 an hour & then switched to a 12 gauge pump-action shotgun (I think we got the Remington 870) for the other 1/2 hour.\\n\\nOnly complaint:\\nThe pump on the shotgun we had kept jamming, my boyfriend thinks it was because they needed to oil it a bit.

For all the marketing around the hotel encouraging you to Check in on Foursquare or get social with the Luxor, providing WiFi to your paying guests seems like a no brainer.\\n\\nWe did receive 2 free drink coupons for each night we were staying at the hotel, so the additional resort fee wasn't that big of a deal as we got 6 drinks out of it. Heads up if you're expecting the included newspaper to arrive in the morning at your room - it doesn't, you need to pick it up in a store near the check-in. \\n\\nAlso, if you're craving coffee in the morning, you'll just have to suck up the additional cost Starbucks charges in the hotel, the prices are jacked up, but to be expected.\\n\\nCons: \\n\\n- End of the strip\\n- Mandatory resort fee\\n- No WiFi\\n- No coffee maker in your room\\n- Worst buffet\\n- Pool isn't open very late (closed at 6pm while we were there)\\n \\nPros:\\n\\n- Dude.

It was the best I ever had in my life, no competitors yet. The appetizers I have tried are very good. This is an upscale dining establishment so expect that the food will be as well. They have a small lot that is always packed so you may have to drive around on the small side streets to find parking. I think this is one of the best spots in the city for a date night!\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "### Input:\nMichael Mina prices with Mickey Mouse food.\\n\\nThe restaurant is set in the beautiful Fairmont-Princess hotel; great bars abound on this property all worth a visit.  Going on the bars look I couldn't wait to see the restaurant, especially the bar adjoining the restaurant.  As I went to the bar, I did notice a restaurant, very bistro/casual almost thrown together.  This would be the dining room.  OUCH!  Staff was okay, maitre d was good.\\n\\nI started with the chilled corn soup which was very good.  I followed it with the 32 ounce Porterhouse (T-Bone), order medium rare, this was not so good ($60).  The strip was cooked rare and the tenderloin was  medium-well , not quite the medium rare I ordered.  If you are \\\"fine dining\\\" and cannot cook a steak you need to find a new job.  Note to anyone - never send a steak back no matter where!  The side dishes come in small metal dishes ($9 a pop) - mushrooms (greasy); mac'n cheese (over-cooked); spinach (gritty).  I decided against dessert.  The wine list is mind blowing expensive and out of keeping for the restaurant, I wasn't exactly spoilt for choice as I looked for wines in the $80-125 range.\\n\\nCannot see coming back.

After ordering at the counter and having to get my own coffee, I realized that what I like most about going out for breakfast is just chilling out and being taken care of... and having to get up 2-3 times to refill my coffee is something I can do at home (the servers had plenty of time on their hands to come around with a carafe).  I took my 7 year old with me and realized afterwards that he more than doubled the price of his main dish by ordering OJ ($3) and a side of bacon ($4.99?!?).  The OJ was fresh squeezed but unless you're in Florida or get lucky with the oranges, its not worth it in Wisconsin (and of course my kid didn't drink it, but I did, because it had pulp!  More a knock on my kid than the restaurant for that).  The bacon was 3 slices that may have been locally sourced, but was nothing special to justify the price.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "### Input:\nFirst and foremost, come with an open mind because it is Fusion Ramen, so it most likely won't be what you're used to if you regularly eat at other ramen houses.\\n\\nThe decor is really nice and simple, which gives a modern feel. I can't say much about the service since my husband and I got take out, but for our limited interaction with the server, she was super friendly and helpful. \\n\\nThe noodles and the chashu are done exceedingly well. The noodles have a great fresh flavor, and I loved that I could taste the egg within the noodle. \\n\\nI got the Shiroi Tonkotsu. As a whole, the flavors blend really well together. The saltiness of the broth with the flavor of the noodle really offset the fatty flavor of the chashu, but drinking the broth alone is too salty for me. The flavor is there; I just preferred it as a dipping sauce for the noodles and meat. The menu states that there is a low salt option for the broth, so I most likely will try that next time.\\n\\nAlso, if you were to try one thing off the menu, I would suggest trying the Hiromaru Buns. They have a really good flavor with just the right amount of spice.  I was actually surprised because I usually can't eat pork belly because it's too fatty for me, but I loved the buns.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "for the way I as well hubby was treated at the other location and assured us that everything would be corrected. \\n\\nThe manager had someone from Enterprise car rental come pick us up and Caliber covered the cost of a rental car for as long as it took to fix the car. Things seemed to finally be panning out.\\n\\nAfter 2 weeks I was informed that the car was ready for pick up and it is now April 6th. We didn't deal with the manager this time but instead a female worker who was very nice. Too bad after having it 2 weeks they couldn't take care of everything. I was pleased with a majority of the issues being fixed but when it isn't the right way it is supposed to be it just stays this never ending frustration. The woman going over the car with us genuinely seems to believe they did a great job which lead me to realize that maybe to them they think it is great work but it is sloppy and lazy. She said they just simply shampooed a couple areas in the car instead of doing the full detail that Caliber billed the insurance company for. The passenger door still wasn't painted all the way either! Also, Hubby has blue lights he installed going down the side of the car and the manager said he wouldn't be able to paint the sidestep because the lights would get painted. Hubby was clear that he did not want the lights removed and with the manager agreeing we didn't think it would be an issue. The first thing I noticed on the passenger side was the lights were removed. They removed the lights anyway and didn't even paint  the side step! I asked the woman about it and she said she had no idea why they did that and to just buy new ones and give them the receipt for reimbursement.\\n\\nThey seem to try but fail. Basically she told me that when I am in the area I can just stop by and get all these little things fixed. I do not have the time to keep coming back because they aren't capable of getting the job right the first time. I do not recommend Caliber Collision ever.

It is located in a strip mall and I would have never heard of it if it wasn't for Yelp. I was pleasantly surprised by the food and the staff. As soon as I walked in I knew it was going to be good because the place was packed. I found the only table available and took a gander at the menu. The chips were crisp and the spicy salsa was delicious. I ordered a quesadilla and the steak ranchero. the steak was cooked in peppers and onions and came with a mildly spicy sauce. My meal was pretty delicious and so was the $3.25 Negro Modello. I looked around at the entrees that sat in from of the people around me and everything looked good and the portions were huge. The food overall was a little greasy, but it was definitely some home cooked mexican (which I could eat every day of my life). I'll have to keep this one on the radar for cheap and good south side fare.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    "quantity not quality.  It was strong -- super strong, but all you tasted was tequila and very little of the margarita flavor that we know and love.\\n\\nOn to dinner, my husband and I ordered the Grilled Fish Zarandeado.  In my opinion very average and not much flavor.  Plus it was very wet below the tortilla so when I went to pick the taco up to eat it, the whole thing fell apart.  The rice was okay, but the black beans were really not to my liking.  All together and even with the sauces the flavors were very bland.  Which was extremely surprising for Mexican food.  One kind of tends to expect spicy and flavorful food.  However, our friend had the sweet potato black bean taco and she liked it a lot.\\n\\nLastly on to service.  While our waiter was nice and a dedicated educator about all the menu items, service was very slow.  We had brought in a specialty cake for our friend's birthday which they very graciously served.  We all promptly ordered coffee to go with the cake.  20 minutes later we were still staring at our cake waiting for coffee.  We finally called the waiter over and asked about the coffee and he said they were out of coffee and it would take another 5-10 minutes to make some more.  We promptly ate our cake without coffee and cancelled the order.  To the waiter's credit, he brought us 4 cups of coffee right before we were  gathering our stuff to leave and said the manager would comp the coffee, but by this time it was 9pm and we were ready to leave.   Interestingly, our original reservation was for 6:30 and we didn't leave until after 9pm.  We like long and leisurely dining when it is our choice, not when it's because of slow service, computer problems, etc.\\n\\nI know the restaurant is only 8 days old, but it may be 8 months before we give it another try.

For several weeks now I have been planning a fieldtrip for my class so that they could taste some of their food.   I've been hyping it up all week to my students and I made my reservation long ago.   They asked me to come by a day or two before to give them the final numbers.   When I came in to do that, I spoke to the owner and the chef and they said \\\"we feel bad but we can not accommodate you!\\\"   They said that they had no record of my reservation and that I didn't speak to the right person.   I called their reservation number and they transferred me to the person who actually makes reservations, that is their fault, who else did I have to speak to?   I can't believe that they are so disorganized.   Anyway, so then I asked to see the reservations they had for the day I asked and voil\\u00e0!   There I was my name plus 20 people !   What shocked me next is that they still refused to accommodate us!   It is really outlandish that they would take a reservation for a school and have me and my administration go trough hoops and hurdles to have this fieldtrip approved, fill out paperwork, get 2 substitute teachers, get and submit permission slips to then just cancel it without notice the night before !   To do this to me is one thing but to do it to our children who have been looking forward to this reward for weeks is unspeakable!!!

Now I know I should have had it fixed way back in the days but I was a kid and didn't know better. It started acting up for the past couple of months but I just walked it off. I couldn't take the pain any more and decided to do something about it. I remember my friend had her wisdom teeth taken out and asked her where she went. She is as much of a BIG BABY as I am. I seriously cry over any little cut, scrap, or splinter. This is why I haven't been to a dentist in....... 7 years. \\nThe girl who made my appointment was so nice a friendly. I would say ask for the funny one but they are all pretty funny. They made me feel very comfortable and were joking around with me. I love that! I was still nervous to hear what the doctor would say but those girls made me laugh. Could have been a nervous laugh though. I got called in pretty quick and sat down in a chair. \\nThe assistant (I believe her name is Carla.....) was nice a chatty with me. She noticed that I was pretty much choking the arm rest. She told me to not worry and as she took my x-rays. THANK GOD THEY HAD PITCH PERFECT PLAYING! I could get my mind off that darn tooth. \\nDr. Lee came into my room and introducted himself and told me what's going on. He explained the options I have, the pros and cons of what I needed, and really explained everything. All in all, YAY I can keep my tooth! I was able to get my tooth fixed and get a cleaning too.

I really didn't like Long Wong's there... the pizza was terrible.  Today Two Hippies had a great $5 special for a turkey and cheese sub with potato salad.  Really good potato salad and pretty good sandwich - a lot of bread though and the description did not tell us that it was a hot sandwich.  We also got an order of fried zucchini that was ok - just ok.  Honestly, Carl's Jr. has better fried zucchini.  So, next time I will try the pizza.

    "### Input:\nI went here with the BF and a couple of our friends tonight for dinner and it was mighty tasty. I'm very glad I looked at Yelp before going so I knew where this place was because otherwise I would've been very lost. The place is extremely small which makes it slightly uncomfortable (like everyone can hear your conversation and you are sitting very close to other parties) but don't let this scare you off because the food is very good. They give you free bruschetta (essentially) which I thought was the best part of the whole meal....so good! The bread was light and delicious and the topping was vinegary, oniony, and fresh tasting....super yummy. We all kind of shared food, the BF and I got the meatball pizza which was tasty, but a bit heavy on the meatball (can I even say that? ha...) it was thin sliced pieces of meatball on top of a basic cheese pizza. The crust is very good and the sauce is also very fresh tasting. The pizza could have used some basil or something to make it have more depth of flavor, but it was good as is. We also shared the gnocchi which are made in house and were light, airy, and delicious! I love eating places that make their cheese and pasta in house....very cool. Our friends got the penne with vodka sauce which was super bacon -y but good. I couldn't eat a whole plate of it (too heavy) but it is extremely flavorful. They also got a pizza and really enjoyed it. Although I wouldn't say this place is the best pizza in town, it is very good and I would love to eat here again. \\n\\nPS: the prices are awesome!!!

The price is right (paid $13.50) for a white pizza with ricotta cheese added and it was delicious.

    "ynasty is the real deal. Come here for traditional chinese dishes with above average service and expect to shell out $20.00 - 25.00 on a meal (including tip).\\n\\nA more Detailed Synopsis:\\nTang Dynasty is now under new management. I can't really comment on how the food used to be mainly because the last time I ate here was many years ago. \\n\\nWith that said the food I received today was very well prepared and the presentation was spot on. It's obvious that the soup stock is made in house and not from a can. You can expect to pay somewhere in the 12-18 dollar range for entrees (mostly depending on how exotic the meat portion is). But don't worry, you'll have plenty to take home for a second meal.\\n\\nYes, you will find some \\\"classic\\\" American Chinese staples on the menu here. However you have to dig through 3 pages of the more traditional menu items  first and search around on the back of the menu to find them.\\n\\nI ordered a hot pot of braised lamb in the Sichuan style of cooking (food prepared in a hot chili sauce made of dried chiles in oil). The heat wasn't overwhelming and accented the individual flavors of the food. \\n\\nA friend and I dined here on a Tuesday around 6 in the evening. The place quickly filled up but the service was still very good, the waitress made a few passes to check on our beverages, and to ask how we liked our food.

    "### Input:\nI've been here quite a few times for after work drinks with coworkers since it's just down the street from where I work. It's an ok place, but with 4 Peaks just on the other side of the parking lot we usually tend to pass on this place. \\n\\nWe went yesterday and it was a disappointment. We got there before they started charging a cover (at 4 pm) otherwise it would have been $10 to get in. I'm guessing that this was to pay for the limited tables, chairs and one tent they rented. Also the band who was singing \\\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\\" and something else by Snow Patrol. Also they were charging $6 for drinks. It was just a little ridiculous. It was pretty much imposable to get drinks or food inside, which those of us who have tried their food before, weren't big fans of anyway. And to top it all off they closed Rubio's next door. \\n\\nA funny sight were these two ladies who brought a little girl who looked like she was 6 and 2 babies who didn't look old enough to walk. The moms' had a beer in one hand and were each pushing their stroller with the other. I know times are tough, but it you can afford buying a $6 beer, you can afford getting a babysitter.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

    ", I may be a little biased because we got here around 2 am, and I know it doesn't get busy until later, but it was seriously dead on a Friday night when we walked in. We stayed about 30 minutes, and left because we couldn't take it any longer. \\n\\nFirst of all, we were on guest list & still had to pay to get in! Guys I can understand, but I'm a female & you want ME to pay? That was issue #1. \\n\\nAfter already being drunk after partying it up at Tryst, we figured we'd continue our night here, since I saw all the good Yelp reviews. I was already skeptical since it IS in Bill's Gamblin' Hall & Saloon, but walking in confirmed this. Decor was nothing better than OK, and the crowd was pretty much the ugliest & worst I've ever seen. Super ghetto. So I figured I'd get myself a kickin' cocktail to forget about it until the party livened up. When I ordered a shot of Hypo & the bartender told me it would be upwards of $20 for just the one shot alone, I wished I had never left Tryst - Drinks were cheaper there! So I ordered a beer, payed way too much for what I consider the most ghetto club in Vegas, and proceeded to chug it.\\n\\nThe only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because they do provide plenty of free seating, and after being on my feet all night at Tryst, it felt good to rest for a bit.\\n\\nI would have stayed longer to see how things change after 3 or 4, but the DJ was terrible... I like to hear Top 40 and/or house at the club... I don't know what this guy was playing, but it was bad. Not one single person in the entire place was dancing, and I can see why. \\n\\nI don't think I will be coming back to this place - I'd rather just stick to whatever club I started at and go back to my hotel when we're done.\n\n### Instruction:\nHere is a review from customer.

It was purely by chance, as it's right across the street from the hotel where they were staying - I'd never gone to it before, and thinking about it now I haven't been back since.\\n\\nNot that it was a particularly bad place as such, it was just a bit bland. Edinburgh city centre has more than it's fair share of upmarket-ish bars where you can get a glass of wine and some nibbles for a not particularly decent price, and so I'm afraid this one just blended in with all the others.\\n\\nIf I were in that neck of the woods again and looking for somewhere to go for a drink, I probably would pop in.

I couldn't even eat a few bites, it was that bad.  I pushed it to the side of the table.  It was really salty and it tasted of anchovies.  I know they are used in the dressing, but you never taste them really.  You could actually taste it.  It was really weird.\\n\\nThe waiter came over and asked if I wanted the food taken away and if I didn't like it.  I thought that was nice because oftentimes waitstaff just ignore it and then clean your plate without mentioning the fact that you barely touched it.  So I liked that he actually asked if I had a problem with it.\\n\\nThe manager came over and asked what was wrong with it.  He was really nice about it and asked if he could bring me something else to eat.  I told him I was okay since I ate the appetizer and shared some of my boyfriend's gyro (which was good!)

It was all breast pieces which for some people is a big plus. \\n\\nPaneer Saag had a slightly pronounced tamarind like flavor, but I was digging the creamy texture of this and they were generous on the paneer pieces. \\n\\nWe picked rice as our side and ordered a side dish of garlic naan (1 large piece, cut in 4) which was crispy and well made. \\n\\nIf you want some fast Indian food, this is probably a good choice.
