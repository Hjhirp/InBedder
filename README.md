# InBedder: Instruction-following Text Embedder

This repository contains the code and pre-trained models for our paper [Answer is All You Need: Instruction-following Text Embedding via Answering the Question]().

We introduce **InBedder**ðŸ›Œ, a text embedder that is designed to follow instructions. Instruction-following text embedder can capture characteristics of texts specified by user instructions. InBedder offers a novel viewpoint that treats the instruction as a _question_ about the input text and encodes the _expected answers_ to obtain the representation accordingly. We show that InBedder is aware of instructions with different evaluation tasks.

## Model List

We released a series of InBedder checkpoints with different sizes. You can easily load these models with huggingface.
