After graduating from middle school, I experienced the \"Cultural Revolution\" where my family was scattered. I was sent to the countryside and later worked in a small factory for 7 years. When I entered the Beijing Film Academy in 1978, I didn't have any specific plans, I just thought that going to university would guarantee my future life. I believe that the reason why we have achieved what we have today, in addition to our own efforts, is related to our complicated growth process, which has also formed the distinctive characteristics of our generation. Some people call me a \"genius\" or a \"professional award winner,\" but in fact, it is in line with an ancient Chinese saying, \"The river flows east for thirty years, and the river flows west for thirty years.\" This is something that cannot be sought after. Once a person's abilities and opportunities come together, they can continuously achieve success, but this situation cannot remain unchanged forever. But I firmly believe that I can still make good movies, that is for sure. Woman: What do you think you gained during your four years at film school? Man: From two aspects. First, going to university is a stepping stone. Going to university allowed me to leap from being an ordinary worker in a small place to entering the field of film. If I hadn't gone to university and had stayed in the factory, no matter how talented I was, I wouldn't be where I am today. Going to university changed my life. So going to university in China is not purely for education, because Chinese university students represent a certain social class, representing a kind of success in one's career. So for me, going to university changed my destiny. As for the education I received in university, there is an old saying: the master leads you in, but the practice is up to the individual. Before entering university, I didn't understand film, but after entering university, I learned what film is. From not understanding film to making films, our teachers gave us the enlightenment of film, so I naturally have a feeling towards the school, but digestion and applying it to other areas depends entirely on oneself.", "value": "What is the man's profession?", "key_prefix": "Passage: ", "value_prefix": "Director"}

{"key": "Host: Hello everyone, today we have invited Mr. Ding Rui, the Marketing Director of a wedding photography studio. Hello, Mr. Ding Rui! Ding Rui: Hello everyone. Host: When taking wedding photos, how should we choose a suitable studio or photography studio? Ding Rui: Generally speaking, there are two criteria. First, you need to think about what style of photos you want to take. Once the style is determined, you can choose based on your budget. Host: Photography studios are very popular among young people. What are the advantages compared to traditional studios? Ding Rui: The advantage is that they can strictly follow the customer's requirements to shoot wedding works. In terms of the works themselves, studios are more suitable for the personalized requirements of young people nowadays. Host: What are the characteristics of traditional studios? Ding Rui: The shooting process of large studios is standardized. Because they have more customers, in order to control the quality, they will operate according to their own standardized processes and require speed. This is the advantage of large studios, but also their disadvantage, because each couple will have various requirements, and it is impossible for large studios to meet everyone's demands one by one. Host: Are there any special considerations when choosing the time for photography? Ding Rui: Yes, I suggest that you try to avoid the peak wedding season. During the peak season, first, the quality will definitely be slightly lower. Second, there may be some requirements that cannot be met during the shooting process, so it is possible to fail during the negotiation with the studio. Furthermore, in terms of clothing, no matter where you take the photos, due to the large number of people waiting to take photos, it is likely that you won't be able to wear the clothes you want to wear.

{"key": "The etiology of Parkinson's disease lies in the lack of a chemical substance called dopamine that can transmit excitement between nerve cells. The fundamental method of treating this disease is to restore the patient's body's ability to secrete this chemical substance. The majority of Parkinson's patients are elderly people over 50 years old. The main symptoms of the patients are gradually worsening limb stiffness, disappearance of facial expressions, trembling of both hands, and unsteady gait. Severe patients may even have difficulty swallowing and speaking. In 1903, the famous Swedish expert in brain transplantation research, Olson, began conducting brain transplantation experiments using mice. He transplanted dopamine-secreting nerve cells taken from the same species of mouse fetuses into the brains of diseased mice, causing the transplanted cells to begin growing new nerve fibers. These budding nerve cells have the same electrical properties as normal nerve cells and can secrete dopamine, thus allowing the diseased mice to recover to the same state as normal mice. Based on animal experiments, in 1982, a tremor paralysis patient at the Karolinska Hospital in Stockholm, who was in a critically weakened state due to ineffective drug treatment, was approved by the hospital's ethics committee to undergo brain transplantation surgery in order to save the patient who was already in a desperate situation. The surgery was performed under general anesthesia. First, the surgeon cut open the patient's back and removed about 2/3 of one adrenal gland. Then, a Mexican medical team led by Olson, Gennasio, and Madrazo successfully performed brain transplantation surgery on a 50-year-old male and a 35-year-old female Parkinson's disease patient. On September 27, 1986, the first successful brain transplantation surgery in China was performed at Xuanwu Hospital in Beijing.
